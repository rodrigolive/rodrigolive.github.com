                  <p>Caching an expensive computation is a great way to improving performance, but when it goes wrong the bugs can be very subtle. It's vital to be sure sure that the cached result is, for all intents and purposes, the same as what the computation would have produced.</p>
<p>A technique I often employ is using a thunk to defer the computation:</p>
<pre class="fake-gist" id="fake-gist-181363">
$cache_helper-&gt;get_value( $key, sub {
   ... produce the expensive result here ...
});
</pre>
<p>If there is a cache hit then the subroutine is simply not executed:</p>
<pre class="fake-gist" id="fake-gist-181364">
sub get_value {
    my ( $self, $key, $thunk ) = @_;

    if ( my $cache_hit = $self-&gt;cache-&gt;get($key) ) {
        return $cache_hit;
    } else {
        my $value = $thunk-&gt;();

        $self-&gt;cache-&gt;set( $key =&gt; $value );

        return $value;
    }
}

</pre>
<p>The <tt>get_value</tt> method must be <a href="http://blog.woobling.org/2009/05/immutable-data-structures.html">referentially transparent</a>; when invoked with the same <tt>$key</tt> it should always produce a consistent result regardless of the state of the cache.</p>
<p>When adding caching to existing code I often accidentally choose a cache key that doesn't contain all the implied parameters since the details of the code I'm caching are no longer fresh in my memory.</p>
<p>The reason I like the thunk approach is that <tt>$cache_helper</tt> can be swapped for something else to easily check for such caching bugs.</p>

<p>For instance, to confirm that a reproducible problem is a cache related bug, you can disable caching temporarily using this implementation:</p>
<pre class="fake-gist" id="fake-gist-181365">
sub get_value {
    my ( $self, $key, $thunk );

    return $thunk-&gt;();
}
</pre>
<p>Or better yet, use an asserting helper in your test environment, where performance isn't important:</p>
<pre class="fake-gist" id="fake-gist-181366">
sub get_value {
    my ( $self, $key, $thunk ) = @_;

    my $value = $thunk-&gt;();

    if ( my $cache_hit = $self-&gt;cache-&gt;get_value($key) ) {
        $self-&gt;check_cache_hit($cache_hit, $value);

        # it's important to return $cache_hit in case check_cache_hit
        # isn't thorough enough, so that this doesn't mask any bugs
        # that would manifest only in production
        return $cache_hit;
    } else {
        $self-&gt;cache-&gt;set( $key =&gt; $value );

        return $value;
    }
};

sub check_cache_hit {
    my ( $self, $cache_hit, $value ) = @_;

    confess "Bad cache hit: $key, $cache_hit != $value"
        unless ...;
}

</pre>
<p>This approach can be used on any sort of cache, from <tt>$hash{$key} ||= $thunk-&gt;()</tt> to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CHI"><tt>CHI</tt></a>.</p>
<p>It's useful to have several <tt>get_value</tt> like methods, to handle the different result types more easily (<tt>check_cache_hit</tt> can be a little intricate, and adding namespacing to keys is always a good idea).</p>

<p>This is useful for other reasons too, for instance collect timing information, to measure the effectiveness of caching, or use different cache storage for different result types.</p>
<p>The key to using this effectively is to make the caching object an easily overridable delegate in your application's code. For instance, if you're using <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org">Catalyst</a> you can specify the subclass in your configuration, or even make it conditional on <tt>$c-&gt;debug</tt>.</p>
<p>Lastly, it's worth mentioning that my sample implementation is actually wrong if false values are valid results.</p>

                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p><a href="http://www.manning.com/conway/">Damian Conway's <em>Object Oriented Perl</em></a> improved my programming more than any other book, when I first returned to programming. By the time I joined <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/07/milestones-in-the-perl-renaissance.html">the Perl Renaissance</a>, I'd learned more about how Perl 5 worked and how to think about approaching problems from Damian's book and my own experiments based on his writings.</p>

<p>Perl 5's default object system is deliberately minimal. It's the combination of two existing ideas introduced in Perl 5 (references and packages) with a method dispatch system. It's very clever in its minimalism; it enforces very little and almost never precludes people from using it to provide more powerful -- or merely different -- object systems.</p>
<p>It's not easy to make a minimal system that flexible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are a couple of warts. It's common knowledge that the default Perl 5 object system is a little bit <em>too</em> minimal. Flexibility is good, but more people benefit from good defaults they only have to change when they're doing something special.</p>
<p>Most of the other problems I have with the basic Perl 5 object system come directly from its influence: Python. I laugh (yes, a sardonic laugh) every time a Python advocate says that Perl 5's object system is a bolted on hack, because Python has many of the same design problems. Yet I digress.</p>
<p>One design decision which Perl 5 stole wholeheartedly from Python is the idea that methods are just subroutines invoked as methods. Python's has first-class functions and allows you to install them in namespaces with simple assignment:</p>
<pre>
<code>class Foo:
    def bar(self)
        print "I'm in bar!"

    baz = bar

def main():
    foo = Foo()
    foo.bar()
    foo.baz()

main()</code>
</pre>

<p>This is not the place to debate the relative merits of Python versus Perl 5 syntax for doing so, but Perl 5 allows something very similar. You can <code>import()</code> methods into classes. <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/04/the-why-of-perl-roles.html">The Why of Perl Roles</a> explains why this is important.</p>
<p>For the most part it works. Unfortunately, when it doesn't work, it <em>really</em> doesn't work.</p>
<h2>Super Fragile Explodealicious</h2>
<p>Consider a silly example:</p>

<pre>
<code>package Foo;

use Modern::Perl;

sub new { bless {}, shift }
sub foo { say shift . '-&gt;foo()' }</code>
</pre>
<p>Now subclass it:</p>
<pre>
<code>package Bar;

use base 'Foo';</code>
</pre>
<p>You can successfully instantiate a <code>Bar</code> object and call <code>foo()</code> on it:</p>

<pre>
<code>Bar-&gt;new()-&gt;foo();</code>
</pre>
<p>What happens if <code>Bar</code> needs to get a method from a role? Here's a <code>Baz</code> package which (manually) imports a <code>foo()</code> method into the calling class. This method emits an informative message, then redispatches to the parent method:</p>

<pre>
<code>package Baz;

use Modern::Perl;

sub import
{
    my $caller = caller();
    no strict 'refs';
    *{ $caller . '::foo' } = \&amp;foo;
}

sub foo
{
    my $self = shift;
    say "foo() in Baz role!";
    $self-&gt;SUPER::foo( @_ );
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, now you <em>can't</em> call the <code>foo()</code> method on <code>Baz</code> objects anymore:</p>

<pre>
<code>foo() in Baz role!
Can't locate object method "foo" via package "Baz" at ... </code>
</pre>
<h2>Insufficient Dynamicity</h2>
<p>This error message makes little sense. The <code>foo()</code> method <em>within</em> the <code>Baz</code> package <em>generates</em> this error.</p>

<p>The problem is how the <code>SUPER::</code> method selector works in Perl 5.</p>
<p>When the Perl 5 compiler encounters a function, it stores compile-time information in the internal data structure which represents functions. This CV, or Code Value, contains a pointer to the package to which the function belongs.</p>
<p>At runtime, the <code>SUPER::</code> method redispatch looks at the package into which Perl 5 <em>compiled</em> the current method, then looks in its list of parent classes to figure out which method to call next.</p>
<p>You can see the problem. This behavior is, I believe, largely an artifact of a particular implementation -- likely the intersection of several sensible design decisions which combined to produce an unfortunate corner case.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this behavior is unlikely to change anytime soon in Perl 5 (<a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/02/the-darkpan-dependency-management-and-support-problem.html">no matter how broken a feature, you can't argue a non-existence proof for code no one can see</a>). The correct behavior is to redispatch based on the current class of the <em>invocant</em>. This is what the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SUPER">SUPER</a> module from the CPAN does instead.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose">Moose</a> solves this problem in a similar way.</p>

                  <p>It drives me nuts every time I connect to an IRC channel, Perl-related or not, and the first thing I'm greeted with is "Don't ask to ask, just ask!" (Over in #perl on freenode, the greeting is "No pasting, at all". BAD USER!)</p>

<p>The problem that the keepers of the channel are trying to solve is when new users come in and ask "I have a problem with arrays, can someone help me?" The regulars of the channel would prefer it if the person seeking help would simply ask the question: "How can I delete an element from the middle of the array." So they put up that chastisement, "Don't ask to ask!"</p>
<p>How incredibly short-sighted!</p>
<p>First, is it really a problem that people ask an introductory "Can someone help me?" Wait, don't answer yet. Don't say "Well, they can just say..." That's not what I asked. Is it a problem? No? Then don't try to fix it.</p>
<p>Second, why not have a more welcoming message to those who you're ostensibly looking to help, and who you'd like to have as part of the community? Why scold people before they've even said anything? How about "Thanks for joining us in #vim! We're glad to answer questions as best we can!" instead?</p>
<p>Third, stop optimizing for your own convenience. Try to consider what your messages are saying to those around you. You just might find the communities you're in to be a nicer place.</p>
<p>People's behaviors are not code that can be optimized by careful code tuning. You can't eke out every last second of efficiency in human interactions.</p>
<p>Addendum: I wrote the welcome for #perl-help on freenode. It says "Welcome to #perl-help. We're glad to help with your questions, but you may need to wait a bit for a response. Posting your code will likely help, please see here: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/" It tells the same things, about how to post your code, and encouraging users to ask questions.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>To start: the title is a false dichotomy. I develop some code and I distribute other code. I happily let Debian and Ubuntu package software such as Vim and X.org for me, not to mention Kmail and glibc, but I also happily use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN">CPAN.pm</a> to manage Perl 5 modules.</p>

<p>A rather silly debate stirs in the Perl 5 community now and then. Someone claims "Your project has too many dependencies!" One response is "Don't reinvent the wheel."</p>
<p>If I could strike words and phrases from polite debate, "bloat" and "reinvent the wheel" would disappear shortly after "utilize" and the verb "to task".</p>
<h2>You May or May Not Like Forest Creatures</h2>
<p>This time, <a href="http://chris.prather.org/perl/command-line-moose-or-knowing-what-you-dont-know/">the debate is about Moose startup time</a> -- in particular, whether the benefits of using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose">Moose</a> for <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> outweigh the disadvantages.</p>

<p>The advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>More declarative class declarations (especially through <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::Declare">MooseX::Declare</a>)</li>
<li>Better object and class flexibility than Perl 5 provides by default</li>
<li>Access to a wide range of Moose design patterns and plugins</li>
<li>Generally less code to maintain to achieve the same feature set</li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantages are:</p>
<ul>

<li>Moose and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP">Class::MOP</a> add a few (12?) extra dependencies to a modern version of Perl 5</li>
<li>Creating Moose objects increases startup time and memory usage by a measurable amount. (Note that I used the word <em>measureable</em>, but not <em>large</em>. You can <em>measure</em> this amount. Whether the amount is trivial or significant depends on your problem domain.)</li>
<li>Rewriting existing, working code may not prove beneficial at this point in the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep that in mind for a moment.</p>
<h2>Truth in Advertising Distributed Software</h2>
<p>LWN covered <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/348084/">a debate on p5p and Fedora mailing lists about the Red Hat practice of distributing Perl 5</a>. If you install the <code>perl</code> package, you don't get what most people reading this would consider "Perl". In particular, <em>you can't use CPAN.pm because it's not installed</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to use CPAN.pm, you have to install the <code>perl-core</code> package. Some might say that the <code>perl</code> installed from the <code>perl</code> package is broken. Certainly it doesn't do what I might expect.</p>

<p>One difficulty that distributors such as Red Hat, Sun (with Solaris), FreeBSD, and Apple (with Mac OS X) discover is that users uses of Perl 5 vary. A couple of megabytes of <code>perl</code> and a few core libraries may suffice to run basic system administration programs necessary to the installation and ongoing maintenance of a system, but I want all of the Perl documentation, the Unicode tables, and even the shared library for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Scalar::Util">Scalar::Util</a> installed correctly before I consider that the preinstalled Perl 5 is usable and complete.</p>
<p>I can understand Red Hat's choice, and mostly I consider their choice of nomenclature buggy.</p>
<p>In some ways, that poor taste grates more than a mistaken technical decision. I have no love lost for the Perl 5 distribution <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~adamk/YAML-Tiny-1.40/lib/YAML/Tiny.pm">YAML::Tiny</a>, written deliberately <em>not</em> to parse <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a>, yet attached to the name like some alien parasite determined to suck the precious bodily fluids from its host.</p>

<p>Yet I also understand why the <code>::Tiny</code> distributions exist: to do a job quickly, using as few resources (runtime and dependency-wise) as possible, solving 80% of the problems without fuss. That's good for developers and good for distributors, at least to a point.</p>
<h2>The Debate is Not Even Wrong</h2>
<p>Sometimes I hate long dependency chains, usually when I have to chase them down during a long installation.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'm happy to reuse code, like a garbage collector or Unicode library or binary-coded decimal or date and time handling I don't have to code or debug or even understand myself.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'm even happy to remove a dependency if it means that more people can use software to which I've contributed, or if it makes the software easier to maintain or easier to install or faster or simpler.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that <a href="http://modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/vision-and-the-perl-5-ecosystem.html">we value different criteria differently at different times for different tasks</a>. I don't mind if Padre takes two seconds to start, if I use it for two hours a day and it doubles my productivity. Contrarily, I'd <em>like</em> <a href="http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-manual.html">Callgrind</a> to run faster, but it's valuable enough as it is (and some of the software I profile has its own flaws) that I don't mind the speed hit it takes for the crazy job it does.</p>

<p>The problem is that the "Your software is bloated!" and "You reinvent the wheel, badly, and you lie about its name!" debate is also a false dilemma. We have a wealth of other options to attempt to make people happier.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could get a single bundle of all dependencies for any CPAN distribution. Obviously there are complications: can you compile XS code, do you have alien library dependencies, are the licenses compatible? Yet improving the <em>distribution</em> of code -- especially with regard to dependency graph version compatibilities and test reports -- could help.</p>
<p>Imagine if Perl 5 borrowed just enough of Moose's declarative class/attribute syntax to make the easy things easy, remove 75% of the boilerplate, and leave Moose and Class::MOP for the other difficult things where it's obvious that you need that full power.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call it <code>Moose::Tiny</code>, but I suspect that a handful of features (declarative class, attribute, and method declarations, auto constructors and accessors) could banish blessed references in new code at almost no startup time cost.</p>
<p>Then again, imagine if Perl 5 could see an order of magnitude improvement in performance. Could that render many of these discussions moot? Certainly these are design goals for Perl 6.</p>

<p>Enrollment is limited to 16 people in total.</p>
<p>Here's the full class description ....</p>
<h2>Intro to Moose</h2>
<p>Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose. Moose is an OO system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of "sugar" on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.</p>
<p>With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose's features include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and coercions, method modifiers ("before", "after", and "around"), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.</p>

<p>This course will cover Moose's core features, dip a toe into the meta-model, and explore some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available on CPAN.</p>
<p>Students are expected to bring a laptop, as you will be writing code during the class. You will also be provided with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled, which will contain a directory tree skeleton and test files.</p>

                  <p>It appears I accidentally kicked off the next round of the Moose performance flamewars. And this time it's dragged Padre in as well.</p>
<p>It's funny how in any significantly large battle of words, it's the zealots on the outside that make the most noise. The people who actually run the projects involved and how the most knowledge about the situation <a href="http://stevan-little.blogspot.com/2009/09/moose-startup-time-over-time_02.html">are generally the most calm about the situation</a>.</p>
<p>Stevan did bring up one good point I hadn't noticed before though, and that is that Moose is rather "OH MY GOD MY RAM!!!" large in size.</p>
<p>Last time I looked at Moose, it was more like 3-4meg in size. That's fairly big, but falls into the same size range as CGI.pm, CSS.pm, DateTime, Template Toolkit, and a number of other packages that comprehensively solve a fairly complex topic (and mostly avoid getting too bloated). These are also the kinds of modules that make the best targets for <nobr><wbr /></nobr>::Tiny modules. But I digress.</p>
<p>Moose has changed over time, mostly improving, and in startup terms at least keeping to a reasonable budget as it grows in size.</p>
<p>The last time I took more than a cursory look at it, <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/34827">in November 2007"</a>, is was bloaty, slowish, slow to start, but very correct and convenient for writing big persistent applications if you didn't mind the speed hit.</p>

<p>As mst asks me to remind people, my previous assessment is now wrong. Moose isn't slow, although the rest are still true. But the Moose team have got their priorities absolutely in the right place.</p>
<p>You absolutely have to prioritise important improvements for your core demographic first. And since the core demographic for Moose is big, complex, persistent applications, it absolutely makes sense to get Moose fast first.</p>
<p>If I rerun the my old Object::Tiny vs Moose::Tiny benchmarks, I get the following for a simple 5-accessor class.</p>

<p>The first set are constructors (the "none" set having no params to the new constructor, and the "all" case having all of them) and the second set are accessors.</p>
<p>The speed is still slow, compared to a trivial hash constructor that doesn't do any param checking, but given that Moose::Tiny is doing work here that Object::Tiny isn't, clearly Moose is fast enough for regular use.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not as fast as the limit-pushing Class::XSAccessor-based Object::Tiny::XS, but it has constructors that are quite fast enough, and accessors (or at least, readonly ones) that are faster than raw native Perl accessors.</p>
<p>Of course, since Padre already uses Class::XSAccessor extensively, converting to Moose does mean that Padre gets slower (in absolute terms anyways). But it's really not that big a difference. It's enough to take any "Moose would be faster" argument off the table, but not much more than that.</p>
<p>But it's clear from these numbers, that if you have a large persistent application, especially one in corporate-land where problems with people cheating and doing weird stuff is endemic and the extra strictness helps a lot, switching to Moose is almost a given at this point (unless you have some weird needs).</p>
<p>And indeed, I have that kind of thing at work. And indeed I have started the process of (sloooooowly) switching us over to Moose for our main 250k SLOC codebase. I even gave a quick tutorial a few weeks ago for the development team.</p>
<p>So I hope this clarifies that I'm not anti-Moose. I'm just pro-"the right tool for the right job".</p>
<p>Which brings us to Padre. Padre is not (yet) a big bloated application.</p>

<p>Maybe it's inevitable that it's going to eventually become one. But if we're going to build a great IDE with lots of features then it's quite likely that it is going to trend in that direction.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you EMBRACE being big, bloated, and slow. Nobody WANTS to be multi-minute startup monstrosity like Emacs. It's not some right of passage for IDEs. It's something you fight.</p>
<p>If you know you are going to have bloating tendencies, you work HARDER to fight the bloat everywhere you can. Every time you add more of the weight that you know is ultimately your downfall, it's a judgement call. Is the functionality REALLY worth it? Is it something that every user will use every day, or something a tiny percentage of people will use once a year?</p>
<p>Is the weight something you can delay loading until runtime?</p>
<p>In the case of Moose, yes we a 0.3 second load penalty. And yes I like to shave time and RAM out of the default startup. But lets ignore that, because there's a bigger problem.</p>
<p>Moose would need to be loaded early, which is a problem. Especially with threading, which we use a lot.</p>
<p>Padre has a pre-threading base load cost (with no features and no open documents) of 35meg, and that jumps to 64meg once the task manager starts spawning off it's normal couple of threads. When we weren't paying attention and just adding features, about 10 releases ago, those costs were more like 55/85meg. By aggressively hunting down wasteful dependencies, and disabling code for dep-heavy features we weren't using yet, we managed to remove 25 dependencies and reduce that 55/85meg to 35/60meg.</p>
<p>If I do NOTHING else other than add "use Moose;" to Padre.pm, that jumps from 35/60meg to 40/78meg. And what do I get for that? Absolutely nothing, except a 0.3 second slower startup, a 0.3 second slower single-instance server spawn, and a 0.2ish second slower thread-spawning speed.</p>
<p>If I actually start to use Moose for real, replacing the 180 classes (and growing) with Moose code, that cost is almost certainly going to grow both in startup time and memory cost. And as a bonus, because we would be ditching Class::XSAccessor in the bargain, Padre would get non-trivially slower.</p>

<p>Now, this doesn't mean it's not worth doing necessarily.</p>
<p>But it means that up front, switching to Moose adds absolutely nothing of value to Padre, and comes with a high cost. Performance is what economists (and MIT algorithms professors) call a "fungible" good (like money and computation) because it's universally exchangeable.</p>
<p>Every 5meg you save in dependency reduction and load-delaying is 5meg you have to spend on features and usability and eye candy later. Do you think those pretty splash screens come for free? <nobr><wbr /></nobr>:) The fact that YOUR desktop monster at work has 3 gig of RAM and only cost $1000 dollars is only relevant if we want Padre to be something that can ONLY be run on something that large.</p>
<p>A number of people have also commented that perhaps if Padre moved to Moose, all these Moose folks would magically parachute into Padre and adopt it and start hacking on it, and we'd leech off their hype and their energy, and hey the train is moving and we'd better be on it.</p>
<p>All of this is entirely speculative. I've yet to hear anyone say that they'd just LOVE to hack on Padre, but because it doesn't use Moose they aren't going to yet (although after this post I'm sure I will in the comments). What I do hear is that people hate using the Wx APIs, and that they are horribly documented. And that is a whole different post <nobr><wbr /></nobr>:)</p>
<p>Most of the main reasons to move to Moose seem to be that it's easier to maintain, and it's just SO damned trendy right now. Everybody else is doing it, it MUST be good.</p>
<p>I hear that kind of talk, and I smell a cargo cult forming.</p>
<p>With clear evidence of the Moose downsides (for Padre), and no clear evidence of the upsides (again, for Padre), what this means is that the burden of proof is on the people that want the switch.</p>

<p>It's not going to be enough to just lobby for the change, they are going to need to actually take a branch, convert some non-trivial percentage of Padre's codebase (ideally the ones that are used in that default base load) and then demonstrate proof that the costs aren't as bad as we thought, and that the maintenance is SO greatly improved that it's worthwhile spending that huge amount of RAM.</p>
<p>If new ideas and new modules are truly going to be great, then just like in science you need to take the OPPOSITE approach to the New Shiny. You need to look at the New Shiny suspiciously and critically, and you find fault and pick holes in the idea until it does one of two things.</p>
<p>1. The idea collapses because of hidden flaws that would have hurt a lot more to discover later (as we are discovering with META.yml).</p>
<p>2. The attention to the flaws in the otherwise good idea attracts the mental and actual effort to those problems early, so they can be repaired or refactored away.</p>
<p>If you are lucky, and get the latter solution, then at the end of the day what you have isn't New Shiny at all. It's something that is just so obviously The Thing You Use To Do That, that the whole thing becomes a non-issue.</p>
<p>Moose may well eventually get to that point, it does have that smell of inevitability to it (much like git does). But clearly it's not there yet, it still has some big issues to address in order to expand it's range of uses out from big persistent things to things that aren't big persistent things.</p>
<p>As an aside, one of the funniest arguments I seem to hit when I complain that Moose isn't useful for simple command line scripts is to use App::Persistent.</p>
<p>Which is to say, I solve the problem of Moose mainly being ideal for big persistent applications, but turning my tiny command line script into a big persistent application <nobr><wbr /></nobr>:)</p>

<p>A second aside, is that while we don't use Moose in the main Padre distro (and we recommend against it for plugins) we DO use it for the Perl 6 plugin. Because in THAT case, it's worth it, because it means we get to have STD.pm.</p>

                  I recently installed perl 5.10.1 on a FreeBSD managed server I have in a datacenter. Being the server fully managed, I do not have root access, so I installed in my own directory. As usual, I typed in: $ sh Configure -de -Dprefix=/usr/home/mylocal $ make $ make test $ make install Almost everything went fine, and I also noticed that the 5.10.1 installation does not require to be able to read /home (or /usr/home, the parent of the user directory, anyhow) anymore (it did so in 5.8.8 and 5.10.0); I can therefore install on an &quot;hardened&quot; FreeBSD box without requiring the ISP to make that directory readable for me. What still happens is that almost everything gets installed where prefix says to. The installer, however, still attempts to install scripts (fex. perldoc, cpan, ...) in /usr/local/scripts (failing for lack of write permission, of course). To fix this I edited config.sh, looked for the installscript variable and changed it to /usr/home/mylocal/bin. Everything worked fine, but is this an expected behaviour? Shouldn&apos;t prefix influence all the installation paths?...

                  <p>Here's some invaluable advice:</p>
<p><b>If you have been hired to fill a non-technical position, do not let anyone know that you possess any kind of technical skills.</b></p>
<p>Do not let your laziness lure you into giving up clues. For example, do not offer to your admin that you can just fix something yourself given the appropriate permissions. Just bite the bullet and wait like the next guy.</p>
<p>Seems selfish? Say that when they start to queue for help. Even if you like to help and manage to serve all your friendly colleagues well within a reasonable amount of time and effort, the hidden cost shows up only later. It's when people higher up in the food chain realize that it is most efficient for the division to have the most technically skilled person carry most of the technical maintenance (and/or development) burden. Prepare for a drag if that happens.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't expect anyone to take this at face value, but it's sad that there's some sort of twisted truth to it.</p>

                  It is again with enormous pleasure that I announce <a href="http://padre.perlide.org">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>, on it's 0.45 release. We are trying to mark some special releases as "stable", somewhat sync'd to <a href="http://rakudo.org/">rakudo</a> (for our "six" <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/download.html">win32 release</a> that bundles Padre with Perl 6), so downstream packagers can do their thing without pulling their hair out for us issuing so many releases (last month, on Padre's birthday, we had 3 releases on a 10-day span). As a result, this release has only bugfixes and translation updates - both more than enough reason for an upgrade :-)<br />

<br />
Also, this has some sentimental value for me as it is my last release of Padre. We have a very nice rotation scheme going on and Ryan52 volunteered for this month, so I gladly handed off the baton - it's been great, but I must confess I do need some vacation from the responsibility!<br />
<br />
Many many thanks to all of you for making Padre such a great IDE for Perl, be it developing or just using it. Also, a big cheer to all translators who's time has been put to Padre - your help is very much appreciated!<br />
<br />
Hey, maybe now I'll actually have time to blog about something other than Padre releases. Yay :-)

One of the best ways to learn a programming language is to pactice. People new to Perl can either make up a new project for themselves or can get involved in an existing open source project. So which projects would you recommend for newbies? How can they get involved?

                </h3>
                <div class="entry-content">
                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>I uploaded <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Dist-Man/">Dist-Man (short for Dist-Manager)</a> version 0.0.1 to CPAN, yesterday. It is based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/module-starter/">Module-Starter</a> , and its documentation still has some remnants from it, but I'm planning to take it into new and exciting directions. The source code is maintained in <a href="https://hg.berlios.de/repos/web-cpan">a Mercurial repository at Berlios.de</a> (called "web-cpan" after the <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/">meta-project for most of my CPAN modules</a> - I'm only given one Mercurial/hg repository per-project there), and there's also <a href="http://bitbucket.org/shlomif/web-cpan/">a bitbucket mirror</a>. Feel free to clone it, fork it, branch it, spin-it-off, or whatever the cool kids are doing now with their distributed version control repositories. I can also give commit bits. The reason I'm using Mercurial is because I'd like to play with it a little more, and because git still often throws me off when using it and still seems counter-intuitive. Like an old email correspondent of mine said "You gotta move, or you stone.".</p>

<p>In any case, I'd like to share some plans and ideas I have in mind for a distribution manager similar to Module-Starter and ask you for your input. Note that my plans take an entirely different approach from <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/10/distzilla-eases-management-of-your-cpan-distributions.html">Dist-Zilla</a>. While Dist-Zilla generates your code from templates, Dist-Man intends to deal with the code as is, and modify it in place, assuming a change is needed.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here's what I'd like to see, or at least seems like a good idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Provide scaffolding for more lib/*.pm t/*.t</b> , etc. files. You can run something like <tt>pl-dist-man new --name=lib/MyPackage/NewModule.pm</tt> and it will create lib/MyPackage/NewModule with all the POD and some sample code ready to go, possibly with some tests under t/, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>POD at the end.</b> - that's what <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001735/">Perl Best Practices</a> recommends, and what <a href="http://perlcritic.com/">Perl-Critic</a> checks for by default. It's not my personal style, but I heard someone complain to me about it in private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Keep a machine-readable configuration file with the settings</b> - keep a configuration file in YAML/JSON/Config-General/etc. format in the distribution that will allow Dist-Man (and other programs) to determine configuration options about the distribution. So, for example, it can use the licence field to determine what to put in the licences of new modules, programs and test scripts. And we can have Build.PL, Makefile.PL read this file and feeding it to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Build/">Module-Build</a> or Module-Install or whatever.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hermetically changing configuration parameters in the code files</b> - you can change the licence in all the files in one step. Or bump the version number in all files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Support for more software licences</b> - perhaps with some integration with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Software-License/">Software-License</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Make judicious use of Template-Toolkit</b> - I'd like to make the generation of the Perl code be based on <a href="http://template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a> so it can be easier to maintain. The base Module-Starter code is at the moment modular, but seems to crying for help from a good templating system.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Good integration with the underlying version control system</b> - when you do <tt>pl-dist-man add lib/MyPackage/File.pm</tt> it will add it to the MANIFEST and the underlying version control system, and you can move files or directories around, hermetically rename namespaces, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>A plug-in to add a diversity statement</b> - see <a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/07/25/standing-out-in-the-crowd-my-oscon-keynote/">what Kirrily Robert wrote about it here</a>. This plug-in will allow the developers to add it automatically to all of their modules. I don't rule out coming up with such a plug-in for Module-Starter too, but I just wanted to mention it here.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>While I have given Dist-Man as an example, this discussion should not be specific to any particular implementation. So what would you like to see in a manager of CPAN distributions?</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Yes, I'm aware that Dist-Man is a fork of Module-Starter, and I tried my best to avoid it, but it seems I had no option. The reason for the fork were the fact that there was a large round-trip delay when applying my patches (usually several months), the fact that I could not get either hgsubversion or git-svn to handle importing the history from its Subversion repository well (see <a href="http://bitbucket.org/durin42/hgsubversion/issue/111/nested-trunk-when-hg-clone-http-module-startergooglecodecom">this hgsubversion issue entry</a>), and the refusal of the Module-Starter maintainer to provide me with a commit access, even after I promised that I will only work on a separate branch, and not commit to the trunk directly (at least not without his permission). I let him know about how I feel, and of my intention to fork the project, and he implied he'd rather see me fork the code instead of complying with one of my needs.</p>
<p>I feel bad about forking it but I feel like I had no choice, and as <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/magic-cauldron/ar01s08.html">Eric Raymond (ESR) says in the Magic Cauldron</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(It bears repeating here that nobody in the hacker community wants projects to split into competing development lines; indeed (as I observed in Homesteading the Noosphere) there is very strong social pressure against forking, for good reasons. Nobody wants to be on a picket line, in court, or in a firefight either. But the right to fork is like the right to strike, the right to sue, or the right to bear arms—you don't want to have to exercise any of these rights, but it's a signal of serious danger when anyone tries to take them away.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So I'm not particularly interested in discussing it further. Please keep the discussion on the topic of what you'd like to see in a manager of CPAN distribution, be it Module-Starter, Dist-Man, Dist-Zilla or whatever.</p>

                  <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2009/09/moose-or-no-moose.php">dave is asking</a> whether we (cpan authors) would consider migrating to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/">moose</a>.<br />
<br />
between moose which brings a lot of nice features, moosex extensions such as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-AttributeHelpers/">attributehelpers</a> (which i'm being said is going core) or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-POE/">moosex::poe</a> (poe integration ftw!), there is so much that moose can bring to developers!<br />

<br />
less fuss, less coding, more fun...<br />
<br />
of course, moose is a bit slow during startup (but not afterwards). but even if i respect adam's will not to slow down <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">padre</a> too much during startup, i'd be in favor of using it nevertheless for padre. after all, we can expect some speed gains if moose's adoption continues to rise.<br />
<br />
so, at least for me, the answer to dave's question is a definitive <span>yes</span>! i am considering switching to moose, and i'll end up doing that when i'll have the tuits to migrate my modules.<br />
<br />
note: i should also add that since i'm at it, i'll also switch my modules to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Dist-Zilla/">dist::zilla</a>, which does a fantastic job to promote lazyness :-) but that's another topic...

                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>Yesterday, Andy Lester opened an <a href="http://github.com/petdance/vim-perl/issues#issue/15">issue</a> for vim-perl on github about adding an automated test suite. I’ve thought about doing something like this before, so last night got busy with prototyping a test harness.</p>
<p>What I’ve got so far (in <a href="https://github.com/hinrik/vim-perl/tree">my fork</a>) is a test file that uses <code>Text::VimColor</code> to generate HTML and compare it against a reference HTML document to determine if the syntax file is doing its job. If a reference file can’t be found, it will create it and <code>skip</code> that test. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<pre>
$ make test
prove -rv t
t/01_highlighting.t ..
ok 1 - Correct output for t_source/perl/basic.t
ok 2 # skip Created t_source/perl/advanced.t.html
ok 3 - Correct output for t_source/perl6/basic.t
1..3
ok
All tests successful.
</pre>
<p>In case of failure, it will use <code>Test::Differences</code> to show you what’s wrong, and write the incorrect output to disk for you to inspect:</p>
<pre>
$ vim syntax/perl6.vim # make a bad change
$ make test
prove -rv t
t/01_highlighting.t ..
ok 1 - Correct output for t_source/perl/basic.t
ok 2 - Correct output for t_source/perl/advanced.t
not ok 3 - Correct output for t_source/perl6/basic.t

#   Failed test 'Correct output for t_source/perl6/basic.t'
#   at t/01_highlighting.t line 77.
#
«output from Test::Differences showing the offending lines»
# You can inspect the incorrect output at t_source/perl6/basic.t_fail.html
1..3
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 3.
Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
Failed 1/3 subtests
</pre>
<p>The only big downside to this is that <code>01_highlighting.t</code> tests all the source files in one go. You currently can’t tell it to only test one specific file.</p>

                  <p>I have been fiddling with Perl for a long while but only in the past year or two really had a community-aware approach. I've used modules since ever but only in the past year or so decided to contribute back.</p>
<p>I have a long way to go till I'll be able to contribute to a lot of projects I want to but I have provided patches so far to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Compile">Test::Compile</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::OpenSSH">Net::OpenSSH</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Jemplate">Jemplate</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::FormHandler">HTML::FormHandler</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::ConfigFromFile">MooseX::ConfigFromFile</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::SimpleConfig">MooseX::SimpleConfig</a> and most recently <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build">Module::Build</a> (already applied in the new 0.35_1) and opened additional tickets for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Controller::BindLex">Catalyst::Controller::BindLex</a> (deprecated), <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SMTP::Server">(Net::)SMTP::Server</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Able::Role">Test::Able::Role</a>.</p>

I just wanted to share this feeling and hopefully push others to contribute as well. Not just to (rightfully) support, improve and help excellent projects (not necessarily just modules), but also to feel this awesome feeling.</p>
<p>Right now I'm trying to help close an issue on <a href="http://perl101.org/">Perl101.org</a> and I hope that at some point I'll get to contribute to more awesome projects such as <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Critic">Perl::Critic</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose">Moose</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst">Catalyst</a>.</p>

                  <p>I’ve recently released a development snapshot of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~dagolden/Module-Build-0.35_01/">Module::Build 0.35_01</a>. This release implements MYMETA.yml.</p>

<p>MYMETA.yml is just like META.yml, in that it follows the <a href="http://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta-spec/">CPAN Meta Spec</a>, but whereas META.yml is generated by the distribution author at packaging time, MYMETA.yml is generated by the end user at configure time after any dynamic dependencies are known.</p>
<p>This is the new approach agreed to in previous Perl QA Hackathons for how configuration tools will communicate dependency information to installers and other toolchain modules. Recent versions of CPAN.pm (including the version released with Perl 5.10.1) already support MYMETA.yml and support should be available soon in CPANPLUS.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can install Module::Build 0.35_01 to see how MYMETA.yml will work.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>I just released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Try::Tiny"><tt>Try::Tiny</tt></a>, yet another <tt>try { } catch { }</tt> module.</p>
<p>The rationale behind this module is that Perl's <tt>eval</tt> builtin requires large amounts of intricate boilerplate in order to be used correctly. Here are the problems the boilerplate must address:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>$@</tt> should be localized to avoid clearing previous values if the <tt>eval</tt> succeeded.</li>

<li>This localization must be done carefully, or the errors you throw with <tt>die</tt> might also be clobbered.</li>
<li><tt>if ( $@ ) { ... }</tt> is not guaranteed to detect errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first problem causes action at a distance, so if you don't address it your code is very impolite to others. The other two problems reduce the reliability of your code. The documentation contains an in depth explanation of all of these issues.</p>
<p>Here is my standard boilerplate for a polite, defensive <tt>eval</tt> blocks:</p>

<pre class="fake-gist" id="fake-gist-178895">
my ( $error, $failed );

{
   local $@;

   $failed = not eval {

       ...;

       return 1;
   };

   $error = $@;
}

if ( $failed ) {
   warn "got error: $error";
}
</pre>
<p>This is extremely tedious when really all I want to do is protect against potential errors in the <tt>...</tt> part.</p>
<p><tt>Try::Tiny</tt> does that and little else; it runs on older Perls, it works with the various exception modules from the CPAN, it has no dependencies, it doesn't invent a new <tt>catch</tt> syntax, and it doesn't rely on any mind boggling internals hacks.</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?TryCatch"><tt>TryCatch</tt></a> and you don't mind missing out on all of its awesome features then you should use <tt>Try::Tiny</tt>.</p>

<p>If you think plain <tt>eval { }</tt> is fine then your code is potentially harmful to others, so you should also use <tt>Try::Tiny</tt>.</p>
<p>Despite its minimalism <tt>Try::Tiny</tt> can be pretty expressive, since it integrates well with Perl 5.10's <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Switch-statements">switch statement support</a>:</p>
<pre class="fake-gist" id="fake-gist-178896">
use 5.010; # or use feature 'switch'

try {
    require Foo;
} catch {
    when ( /^Can't locate Foo\.pm in \@INC/ ) { } # ignore
    default { die $_ } # all other errors are fatal
};
</pre>

<p>For backwards compatibility you can obviously just inspect <tt>$_</tt> manually, without using the <tt>when</tt> keyword.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>In 1987, not even Larry Wall could have predicted the Web. <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/04/the-two-worlds-of-perl-deployment.html">Perl's first wave of adoption was system administration</a>. Perl's second wave of adoption was as a language for CGI programming.</p>
<p>My goal for Perl 6 is a language for general-purpose programming.</p>
<p>One of the design goals for Perl 5 was to remove arbitrary distinctions. Perl 4 was embeddable, but extending it for Oracle or Sybase or access to other database systems meant recompiling the Perl 4 binary. This is why you still occasionally see references to oraperl or sybperl.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/who-benefits-from-the-cpan.html">Perl 5's greatest benefit is the development of the CPAN</a>. That's not necessarily something Larry could have predicted in 1993 -- and certainly not in 1987 -- but designing Perl 5 for extensibility made the CPAN possible.</p>
<p>Fifteen years after the release of Perl 5.000, the <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/">Perl 5 community is still discovering ways to improve CPAN and the Perl 5 extension process</a>.</p>

<p>That's normal. That's expectable. As a language designer, the best you can hope for is to encourage this kind of evolution and revolution. Mostly you have to hope that none of your design decisions actively <em>prevent</em> it. You also have to accept that you <em>won't</em> get it all right the first time.</p>
<p>I've written before that <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/03/the-relentless-progression-of-baby-steps.html">rapid, feedback-aware iteration is an effective way to understand a problem and find working solutions</a>. Feedback from real users with real uses is invaluable (see also why <a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">Pugs</a> and, later, <a href="http://www.rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> multiplied the velocity of Perl 6). You won't understand the problem fully until you've had to balance multiple, sometimes contradictory, constraints. Just as no battle plan survives contact with the enemy, no software design survives contact with users unscathed. You may find that you're painting yourself into a corner.</p>

<p>There's a balance: you don't want to cause users unnecessary pain by rapid, arbitrary change, but <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/02/backwards-compatibility-is-technical-debt.html">legacy code and features can hamstring a project</a>.</p>
<p>(Sebastian Riedel's <a href="http://labs.kraih.com/blog/2009/08/version-numbers-and-backwards-compatibility.html">Version Numbers and Backwards Compatibility</a> demonstrates a conundrum: how do you get this feedback early in a project's life when the CPAN is such a compelling distribution mechanism? The CPAN ecosystem provides few tools to manage rapid yet backwards-incompatible releases.)</p>
<p>That balance is especially difficult in language design, where consistency of expression and abstraction and concept is important. <a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc">361 contradictory Perl 6 RFCs</a> demonstrate that Perl 5 has real flaws, but a language revision which adopted those RFCs in whole would be a mess.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/07/expressing-visions-for-perl-5.html">A vision for the present and future of a software project is important</a>, but that vision must also seek uniformity (where possible) and emphasize differences (where possible). Similar things should look similar and different things should look different. You see this in debates over operator overloading: the C programming language's polymorphic addition operator manages to add integers and floats. You can overload it in C++ to add matrices and irrational numbers. Yet some people rightly complain when someone else overloads it to append to files across a network.</p>

<p>I don't believe anyone <em>really</em> knows how to design a programming language that's sufficiently internally consistent that it's easy to begin, possible to master with minimal pain, well-optimized for its current domain strengths, and ready to take over the Next Big Niche.</p>
<p>I don't know many (successful) general purpose languages which haven't switched their focus more than once. I think "success" for a programming language means that people use it for purposes the designers never anticipated.</p>
<p>That's why <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/07/deprecated-pointy-bits.html">discussions about Perl 5 deprecations</a>, for example, frustrate me. I'm sympathetic to the desire not to break existing code (though people always have the option <em>not</em> to upgrade), but I want to remove arbitrary restrictions and smooth off rough edges and make programming tomorrow a little more joyful than programming today.</p>
<p>In other words, bring on Perl 5.11 and 5.12. 5.10.1 isn't the end of the line. I'm not stopping there. Bring on <a href="http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/39411">Rakudo Star</a> and Parrot 2.0 and all of the intervening releases. I don't care if the software I rely on isn't "done", whatever that word means in this context. I care if it's useful, usable, and if it continually gets a little bit better based on feedback from real world users.</p>

<p>Sure, there's change involved. Certainly change produces pain sometimes. Yet without change, there's no progress -- and I don't believe we've arrived at the perfect language in which to write perfect software yet.</p>

                  <p>Installing Perl::Critic from CPAN may be hard for a beginner, but I consider perlcritic useful for them too.<br />
Possible problems are using CPAN shell and failing installations of modules. Of course you can use it directly on <a href="http://perlcritic.com/">perlcritic.com</a>, but you will not be able to use command line options like verbosity level and there can be privacy concerns. So I decided to create an executable for Windows. It was necessary to patch Module::ScanDeps to pack Perl::Critic correctly. I committed changes to SVN and when new version will be released, you will be able to build it yourself on any OS. Command line to build is<br />
<tt><br />
&gt; pp -M PPI::XS -M Readonly::XS %PATH_TO_YOUR_BIN%/perlcritic<br /></tt></p>
<p>PPI::XS and Readonly::XS are C versions of parts of PPI and Readonly. They are used automatically by corresponding modules when they are available.</p>

<p>Now beginners can use Perl::Critic without installing it. I'm planning to update this file periodically. I also want to make Perl::Critic more friendly to beginners.</p>
<p>Please link to <a href="http://chorny.net/perl/perlcritic.html">http://chorny.net/perl/perlcritic.html</a> - page with instructions, not to exe file directly.</p>

                  <p>After the chat about the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a> web site that resulted in a post about <a rel="nofollow">Improving the Moose experience</a> I asked <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://foxfirefey.dreamwidth.org/">foxfirefey</a> to look at the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a> website as well with a fresh and critical eye.</p>

<p>Here is what she wrote:</p>
<p><i>First thing about the Padre website: I don't see a <b>screenshot</b> of the program in action.</i></p>
<p><i>I've heard you described it as being something <b>friendly for newbies</b> to learn Perl on, but I don't see that as a listed feature.</i></p>
<p><i>When I look at it, I want to know <b>what it can do that my current thing doesn't?</b>. Granted, IDEs have always intimidated me, because for some reason I find it hard to do things in them that I know how to do on the <b>command line</b>.</i></p>

<p><i>So, for instance, <b>syntax checking</b>.<br />
My current stuff doesn't do that, but what does the syntax checking do? Does it check on the fly as I finish a line? Is it an action I run? Does it warn me if I'm using strict and bust a variable name I haven't declared yet?</i></p>
<p><i>I'm curious, is there a console with Padre that I can do <b>Perl on the fly</b> in?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Refactoring tools:</b> what kind of refactoring tools? Does it help me rename variables? Turn sets of functions into classes?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Context sensitive help</b>: I think I've heard you mention autocompletion, is that under this category? Or looking up system functions on the fly?</i></p>

<p><i><b>Padre walkthrough for newbies</b> "Installing Padre" and then "Using Padre on DreamWidth code" and then "Making changes with Padre" and an overview of how Padre's features work when trying to code. Not just how to use Padre, but specific examples of using Padre on the code</i></p>
<p><i>I did a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dw-dev-training.dreamwidth.org/2416.html">bug walkthrough</a> on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dreamwidth.org/">DreamWidth</a> to try and help somebody who didn't know where to start It was less helpful for them than it could have been BUT other people did ones after me that were much better</i></p>
<p>I'd like to thank <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://foxfirefey.dreamwidth.org/">foxfirefey</a>, for the comments. I think it will help us a lot to improve the content on the Padre web site.</p>

                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>A recent thread on use.perl.org brought up one of the worst myths of Perl 6: That Perl 6 is harming Perl 5.</p>
<p>Andrés N. Kievsky commented in <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=43716&amp;cid=70320">a thread on use.perl.org</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>drop this insane perl 6 thing immediately. Give us good, stablethreading in perl 5 instead of self-hosting grammars in perl 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>proper OO syntax, multithreading, better speed ... are major issues in perl 5 that should have priority over perl 6 work. You can't expect me to believe that the perl 6 team can't work on that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There's so much misunderstanding here about how open source works, I'm going to ignore the ways that Perl 5 has benefited from the process of creating Perl 6.</p>
<p>The problem with Kievsky's assessment is that it assumes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>contributors are finite</li>
<li>contributors are interchangeable</li>
<li>contributors can be directed.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three are wrong.</p>
<p>First, there is a <strong>vast, unbounded talent pool</strong>. The set of people available to work on Perl 6 is not limited to those who would otherwise be working on Perl 5. It's not as if there's a box of people that cannot grow or be added to. There are many contributors who have joined the Perl 6 project without having ever worked on Perl 5. In this instance, Perl 6 has actually brought people into Perl under the Perl 6 banner.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>not everyone can work on the same parts of different projects</strong>. The tasks on Perl 6 may well be very different than the Perl 5 improvements that Kievsky would like to see. I have been contributing to Perl 5 for years, but I'm not at all available to help on the Perl 5 tasks he wants, because they're not in my area of expertise. However, I can help a lot with Perl 6 tasks, and not just programming. Parrot and Perl 6 are a better fit for me.</p>
<p>Finally, and most disturbing, Kievsky seems to think that by wanting something badly enough, people will work on those tasks. Unfortunately for this idea, <strong>there is no one directing Perl 5 development tasks</strong>, and nor can there be. Open source contributors are volunteers. They work on what they want to work on. Even if I was clamoring for those Perl 5 improvements, I'd rather keep a great programmer working in the Perl community working on Perl 6 rather than leaving Perl entirely because there was no work she felt like doing.</p>
<p>The only way to get a feature added to Perl 5, or any open source project, is to write it yourself, or to encourage others to work with you on it. It's the way of open source.</p>
<p>Perl 6 and Perl 5 development work are not mutually exclusive. Work will continue on Perl 5 long after Perl 6 has hit prime time.</p>

                  <p><b>My top conference picks</b><br />

The other week my arch-nemesis, <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/">Adam Kennedy</a>, asked <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=43687&amp;cid=70260">how the hell do I find out about all these conferences</a>. This was a reference to <a href="http://www.manifest.org.au/">Manifest</a>, where I did some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157622100698168/">photography</a> and generally had an absolute blast.</p>
<p>I wish there was some central repository of events that was kept up-to-date, provided an API and iCal feed, and contained rich meta-data. There's none that I know of; in fact, the closest I've found is Facebook, where one can use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Facebook::API">the API</a> and <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/FQL">Facebook Query Language</a> to exttract information on people and events. I would give a talk on a few practical applications, but as it depends heavily on friends willing to disclose their interests and activities to facebook, my augmented social life currently only rocks only if I'm living in Portland or Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The way I normally find out about conferences is still through good old-fashioned word-of-mouth. The ones I would like to attend in the coming year that I'm presently aware of are:</p>
<p><b><i>Technical conferences</i></b></p>
<dl>
<dt><b><a href="http://conferences.yapcasia.org/ya2009/">Yet Another Perl Conference Asia (YAPC::Asia)</a>, 10-11 September 2009, Tokyo, Japan</b></dt>
<dd>The world's biggest Perl conference. I've never been, and I'm missing it this year due to an already full travel schedule. I'd <i>love</i> to attend next year.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon">Linuxcon</a>, September 21-23rd 2009, Portland OR, USA</b></dt>
<dd>I've never been to Linuxcon, but it's in Portland, and I love Portland. Enough said.</dd>

<dt><b><a href="http://gracehopper.org/2009/">Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing</a>, September 30th - October 3rd 2009, Tuscon AR, USA</b></dt>
<dd>Most of my friends and associates have probably heard me soapbox about how we have appalling gender equality in IT, and especially in FOSS. The Grace Hopper conference provides an <a href="http://gracehopper.org/2009/conference/2009-ghc-full-conference-program/">extensive programme</a> on women in computing, and I'm incredibly sad I won't be there this year. ;(</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Open Source Developers' Conference (OSDC)</a> - 25-27th November 2009, Brisbane, Australia</b></dt>
<dd>OSDC is a beautiful melting pot of developers from different languages, with healthy competition between speakers. It also features the world's best lightning talks. This year OSDC is in beautiful BrisVegas, making it the perfect place to spend a few days afterwards to relax.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa09/">Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA)</a>, November 1-6th 2009, Baltimore, USA</b></dt>

<dd>LISA has been on my list of conferences to attend for years now, as apparently it's <i>the</i> sysadmin conference to go to.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/">Linux.conf.au</a> - 18-23rd Jan 2010, Wellington, New Zealand</b></dt>
<dd>LCA is, in my opinion, the world's hardest conference to speak at. They have a huge number of submissions each year to their call-for-papers. LCA2010 is happening in Wellington, New Zealand, which features the world's second-best coffee, most civilised Perl Mongers (sponsored beer at the meetings), and is choc full of awesome people.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/">Social Linux Expo (SCALE)</a>, 19-21st February 2010, Los Angeles, USA</b></dt>
<dd>I only learnt about SCALE toady. Last year's speaker list contains at least half a dozen people I'd cheerfully fly across the world to see, so this has shot very high on my desired conference list.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://sage-au.org.au/display/conf/Home">SAGE-AU</a>, The System Administrators Guild of Australia, August 2010</b></dt>

<dd>SAGE-AU was my first conference speaking experience, except that I never spoke. I was pulled in as a last-minute replacement speaker for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randal_Schwartz">Randal Schwartz</a>, who was having troubles making it to the conference, but eventually made it. Enchanted by the idea that I <i>could</i> speak at conferences, the next few SAGE-AU conferences became the start of my speaking career. SAGE-AU also has the best conference dinners ever, which makes me super-sad I missed the conference dinner at <a href="http://sage-au.org.au/display/conf/Conference+Dinner">DreamWorld</a> this year.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a>, June 2010, Portland OR, USA</b></dt>
<dd>I missed Open Source Bridge this year, and I cried and cried, because it sounds like the best conference I've never been to. Not only is it in Portland, which I love, but it's organised by a team including <a href="http://www.chesnok.com/">Selena Decklemann</a>, whom I love, and has a <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2009/sessions">awesome list of speakers</a>. Nothing is going to stop me from attending in 2010.</dd>

<dt><b><a href="http://yapc10.org/yn2009/">Yet Another Perl Conference, North America (YAPC::NA)</a>, June 22-24th 2010, Pittsburgh USA</b></dt>
<dd>I've never made it to a YAPC::NA before, but I had such a blast at YAPC::EU that I'm now convinced that I have to go.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Open_Source_Convention">OSCON</a>, The O'Reilly Open Source Convention, July 2010, Portland OR (Hopefully), USA</b></dt>
<dd>I've been to two OSCONs now, and both of them have events that represent some of the best experiences of my life. For those of you who have noted that OSCON is expensive, then consider submitting a talk proposal (speakers get in for free), or <i>tutorial proposal</i>. Tutorial presenters usually qualify for travel assistance, and for me this makes OSCON one of the most cost-effective conferences in the world.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/">Yet Another Perl Conference Europe (YAPC::EU)</a>, August 2010, Pisa, Italy</b></dt>
<dd>YAPC::EU was my first YAPC this year, and I had an absolute blast. The thought of attending again just thrills me with excitement. Plus, if Italy makes coffee anywhere near as good as they make in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lygon_street">Lygon Street</a>, it will be worth it for the caffeine alone.</dd>

</dl>
<p><b><i>Technical unconferences</i></b><br />
There are more technical unconferences than I could possibly poke a stick at, and I'd go batty trying to list them all. Instead, I only want to make a few special (and local) mentions here.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b><a href="http://barcampmelbourne.org/">BarCampMelbourne</a> - 12-13th September 2009, Melbourne, Australia</b></dt>
<dd>The last Melbourne BarCamp rates as one of the best unconferences I've ever attended, and I expect the next one will be even better! There are only limited spots, so now's the time to sign up.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://vic.au.stixcamp.org/">StixCamp</a>, Victoria, Australia</b></dt>
<dd>Last year was the first ever StixCamp in Australia. Grab a bunch of geeks, get them to bring tents and camping equipment, and take them out to a beautiful winery in central Victoria. Mix in high-speed wireless Internet, some amazing food, and a wonderful atmosphere, and you have an experience not to be missed.</dd>

<dt><b><a href="http://baacamp.org/">BaaCamp aka KiwiFoo</a>, New Zealand</b></dt>
<dd>An invite-only event; the running joke is this should be called <i>FontCamp</i> (Friends of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Torkington">Nat Torkington</a> Camp). BaaCamp sports an absolutely fascinating mix of people, superb catering, and late-night <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Werewolf</a> games. Plus, it's in beautiful New Zealand. I've only been to a single BaaCamp, but would love to be back for a second.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b><i>Culture</i></b><br />

I have more enough than enough interests to keep me occupied, and many of these have associated expos, conventions, festivals, and the like. Again, there are more of these than I could possibly list, so highlights only are below.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.paxsite.com/">Penny Arcade Expo (PAX)</a> - 4-6th September 2009, Seattle, USA</b></dt>
<dd>PAX is a gaming festival, and I would dearly love to be there year, but unfortunately I'll be missing out.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=109179473894">Melbourne Pirate Parade</a> - 21st September 2009, Melbourne, Australia</b></dt>
<dd>Come dressed as a pirate, yer scurvy dogs, and let's plunder Melbourne together!</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.manifest.org.au/">Manifest</a> the Melbourne Anime Festival - August 2010</b></dt>

<dd>I love Manifest. It's a huge celebration of anime culture, with the cosplay competition being the highlight of the weekend. I've been lucky enough to have a camera at at both <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157607549394472/">Manifest 2008</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfenwick/sets/72157622100698168/">Manifest 2009</a>. There's also a single-day Minifest that happens each year in April.</dd>
<dt><b><a href="http://www.comic-con.org/">San Diego Comic Con</a> 22-25th July 2010, San Diego, USA</b></dt>
<dd>I've never been to SDCC. I keep hearing amazing stories every year. It had better not clash with OSCON.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you'd like to see me at a conference that I haven't mentioned above, it's quite likely because I haven't heard about it! Drop me an <a href="mailto:pjf@cpan.org">e-mail</a> and let me know, especially if there's an open call for papers.</p>

                  <p>It seems I didn't announce it here, but <a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test-Run</a> version 0.0120 was converted to <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose, the postmodern object system for Perl 5</a>. After I uploaded all 0.0120-related modules, I was looking for more Moosification, and decided to try and convert runprove to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Getopt/">MooseX-Getopt</a>, while still passing all tests.</p>
<p>After a lot of playing with the <tt>has</tt> attributes to get them I ran into what appeared to be a problem which I could not overcome: I could not configure it not to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Getopt-Long-Descriptive/">Getopt-Long-Descriptive</a>, in case it found it was installed. I didn't want to use it, because I wanted my help display.</p>

<p>After talking about it on <a href="irc://irc.perl.org/#moose">#moose</a>, I was told that it is indeed a limitation. I decided to fix it and did it by adding a new parameter. However, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~bobtfish/">t0m</a> told me that I should do it by extracting the non-GLD dependent functionality into a separate role, and doing it. I did it, and he had some further comments which I incorporated into my <a href="http://github.com/shlomif/MooseX-Getopt/tree/master">MooseX-Getopt repository</a>. My enhancements are not in the CPAN module yet, but they are going to be soon.</p>
<p>And I'll leave you with a <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl">#perl</a> discussion about Chuck Norris:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  2010 is planned more or less as a refactoring year.
 &lt;DrForr_&gt;  A whole *year*? What physical plane of existence do you reside
            on?
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  DrForr_: there's also bugs to fix and systems to care for and
            things like that. it's not that we're locked into the closet
            and a year later a new, shiny product is released. ;)
 &lt;DrForr_&gt;  Closet optional.
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  I'm not a wonderwoman refactoring half a million lines of perl
            in a week, sorry. :)
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: Chuck Norris refactors 10 millions lines of perl
            before lunch.
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  rindolf: hm. that's the reason.. I'm not as hairy as chuck
            norris and I don't have a beard...
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: ah.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: Chuck Norris also wrote a complete Perl 6
            implementation.
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  rindolf: I heard, he already wrote Perl 7.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: yes.
         *  rindolf wants to be as awesome as Chuck when he grows up.
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  rindolf: I envy you. I'll never be as awesome without a beard.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: heh.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: it doesn't matter if you're rigid on the outside as
            long as you're rigid on the inside.
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  chuck norris doesn't make mistakes.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: Chuck Norris corrects God.
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  rindolf: I'll apply as his secretary.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: as Chuck's?
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  rindolf: yes.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: OK.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Chuck Norris doesn't code. When he sits next to a computer, it
            just does whatever he wants.
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  I'll tell my boss tomorrow. Chuck is who he wants.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: Chuck Norris is his own boss.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  Su-Shee: if you hire him, he'll tell your boss what to do.
 &lt;Su-Shee&gt;  good point.

                  <p>I just recommended Moose to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://foxfirefey.dreamwidth.org/">foxfirefey</a> who looked at the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/">Moose page</a> and told me the following:</p>
<p><i>This poor Moose page is not enlightening me much. I don't know what a postmodern object system, and then it links to a very long talk that has nothing to do with Moose. And I see the word <b>roles</b> and then it makes me kind of embarrassed, because I don't know what they are, but it feels like I should if I'm a halfway decent CS person</i></p>
<p>I would add <i>Isn't 1999, kinda old?</i></p>

<p>foxfirefey went on:</p>
<p><i>I <b>do</b> like the Moose layout background a lot. It's pretty. And the site itself looks very good, and that's a good mark of a module that cares about itself, that somebody thought it was important enough to make a pretty site for.</i></p>
<p>So here a few ideas that might help:</p>
<p>I think that page might be better if it included</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of features that people knowing object oriented understand</li>
<li>Links to short explanations of phrases that might need explanation, eg. roles</li>
<li>A simple example on the main page</li>

<li>A prominent link to a very short tutorial. (5-10 pages).</li>
<li>More links to other <b>selected</b> turorials, screencasts, slides and recorded talks</li>
</ul>
<p>I worry that the link to the article about the post modern object system on perl.com is going to mislead other people as well, so I'd probably make that less prominent.The chronological list of articles is good for history but not useful to someone who is just interested in what Moose is. So it might be better if the site was pointing out the few important articles and have the chronological list lower or anoter page.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/">mst</a> suggested to add a promotional link to <a rel="nofollow">the #moose channel on irc.perl.org</a> so you can talk to people there and a link to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://git.shadowcat.co.uk/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=gitmo/moose-website.git;a=summary">git repo</a> of the Moose web site if you'd like to patch it.</p>

                  <p>I now have 198,586 cities in my database, complete with latitude and longitude for all of them. As a result, <a href="http://eric.hexten.net:3000/country/australia/new%20south%20wales">my pet project</a> allows you to click on countries, see the regions for that country and then click on a region to get a paged city list (1576 cities just for New South Wales) and see a map of any city you click on.</p>
<p>The site still doesn't do anything amazing and it's not particularly user-friendly. That's because I'm discovering that managing data quality is really hard when working with only free data. Not quite sure why <a href="http://eric.hexten.net:3000/country/american%20samoa/">American Somoa</a> has a region named "00", but there you go. In fact, I have 54 regions in the database named "00".

                </h3>
                <div class="entry-content">
                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>First: This is neither a complaint nor a criticism. I understand the intent of the CPAN and its goals. I believe it meets those goals effectively.</p>
<p>If you talk to Jarkko about the CPAN, he'll likely tell you that it's primarily a distribution service. It's a series of regularly updated mirrors containing some metadata and an archive of redistributable code. Many proposals for enhancements and replacements and reinventions in other languages have come and gone. Most of them have tried to add complexity to this simple base. That's one reason they haven't succeeded.</p>
<p>This half of the CPAN makes code available to users.</p>
<p>Another half of the CPAN is PAUSE, the service which allows CPAN developers to upload their code to the metadata analysis and code distribution service.</p>
<p>The third half of the CPAN consists of the tools used to find and install CPAN distributions with partial or full automation. It's an optional part of the CPAN experience, but it demonstrates that the CPAN ecosystem also includes tools which rely on the metadata and mirroring services which the CPAN makes available. Without this metadata, the CPAN would be much less useful.</p>

<p>It's also the metadata which allows services such as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a> (which many people consider the face of the CPAN), <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/">RT for CPAN</a>, <a href="http://static.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a>, <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/">CPANTS</a>, <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a>, <a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/">CPAN Forums</a>, and plenty of other services now and in the future.</p>
<p>That's what the CPAN is: a loose federation of sites and services built around a code and metadata mirroring system, with an upload service for registered developers.</p>

<h3>Who's It For?</h3>
<p>I believe the <em>primary</em> beneficiaries of the CPAN are active CPAN developers.</p>
<p>By uploading your code to the CPAN, you get worldwide mirroring and distribution. You get test results from a wide variety of platforms and versions. You get bug tracking, documentation hosting, reviews, and feedback on the quality and efficacy of your distribution.</p>
<p>You get to push your installation and dependency management to CPAN installers. Because CPAN tools are effective about gathering dependency information and publishing it in a form that other CPAN tools can understand, the easiest way to install distributions from the CPAN is with a CPAN shell such as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN">CPAN.pm</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPANPLUS">CPANPLUS</a>. Utilities exist for free software distributions such as Debian and Gentoo to wrap CPAN distributions into OS packages where the packaging system can manage them, but they're necessarily specific to individual platforms, where the CPAN shells can run on any operating system where Perl 5 runs.</p>
<p>One strong benefit of the existing CPAN shells is that they run distribution test suites before installation <em>by default</em>, refusing to install when test failures occur. This provides strong pressure to review, report, and fix test failures; the focus is on quality by default.</p>

<p>Active CPAN developers know when and how to report bugs, how to read CPAN Testers reports, and how to force installations. They may know how to use the <a href="http://backpan.perl.org/">BackPAN</a> or to use an earlier version of a dependency.</p>
<p>This brings up a subtler feature of the CPAN which optimizes the experience for active CPAN developers: you always get the newest version of a distribution. While a PAUSE/CPAN shell hack allows developers to upload a development version which people cannot install accidentally, there's little ability to specify in dependencies that you want users to install a specific version of a dependency. One accidental upload in any of a dozen distributions could render half of the distributions on the CPAN uninstallable.</p>
<p>In some ways, this feature creates and exacerbates a problem. It can be difficult to bundle a distribution and all of its dependencies as the dependency graph can change during the bundling process.</p>
<h3>A CPAN for Normal Users</h3>
<p>What would a CPAN look like for normal users? ActiveState's PPM isn't a bad model in some ways, though it hews too closely to the CPAN itself in others. Binary repositories for Linux distributions have other advantages. I can think of several attributes of a CPAN enhancement for non-developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary distributions, or at least not requiring the presence of a C or C++ compiler and <code>make</code> utilities. This could be optional.</li>

<li>Run the tests on installation for verification and reporting purposes. This could also be optional, but I like the quality-by-default approach.</li>
<li>Bundling a distribution and all of its dependencies into a single, installable package.</li>
<li>Automatic relocation (perhaps through the use of <code>local::lib</code> or something similar) to allow multiple versions of a single distribution installed and usable.</li>
<li>Regular, tested updates to bundles and the contained dependency graphs.</li>
<li>Working with upstream.</li>
<li>Integration with OS packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter two I have no good ideas how to accomplish. Working with upstream can be difficult in the normal case; not everyone looks at CPAN Testers reports or the CPAN's RT or other CPAN extensions. Building OS packages seems like a lot of trouble and a lot of duplicate work.</p>

<p>Even so, the Perl 5 ecosystem already has most of the tools necessary to build such a thing. We can build a dependency graph for most CPAN distributions, and we can identify those without accurate graphs. We can calculate the likelihood of tests passing on various Perl 5 versions and platforms given that graph. It only takes a little bit of code to bundle most graphs into a dependency-first installable bundle, and a small loader module could set <code>@INC</code> paths appropriately.</p>
<p>Given a list of dependencies, it's possible to analyze the potential graphs for solutions and identify potential points of conflict or failure. If solutions exist, the software could create an installable bundle. Source code is the easiest, but a binary is possible.</p>
<p>It's also possible to keep these graphs and bundles up to date, with a lag of a few hours to a couple of days. Though calculating the possible solutions from a graph may be expensive, most of the information is cacheable.</p>
<p>Would people use such a system? I don't know. Should it replace elements of the current CPAN system? Never; it addresses a different purpose. Is it worth building? The idea continues to tickle my mind.</p>

                  <p>Let's say you created a branch from the commit <tt>foo</tt>, and then committed the change <tt>bar</tt>:</p>

<p>If you use <tt>git pull --rebase</tt> that apply your <tt>bar</tt> commit on top of the upstream, avoiding the extra merge commit and creating a linear history:</p>

<p>If you're used to subversion, this is very similar to what running <tt>svn up</tt> before <tt>svn commit</tt> does.</p>

<p>At this point you can push your work, and no evil manage will "break" your branch. Using <tt>git pull --rebase</tt> is a safe and natural fit when using a shared git repository.</p>
<p>Note that <tt>rebase</tt> will <em>recreate</em> those commits, there are two commits called <tt>bar</tt>, one whose parent <tt>baz</tt>, and one whose parent is <tt>foo</tt> which is still available in <tt>git reflog branch</tt>:</p>

                </h3>
                <div class="entry-content">
                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p><a href="http://moose.perl.org">Moose</a> lets you provide a callback that is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/lib/Moose/Manual/Attributes.pod#Triggers">invoked when an attribute is changed</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of "height" and "width" attributes automatically updating an "area" attribute when either of them is modified:</p>
<pre class="fake-gist" id="fake-gist-176887">
has [qw(height width)] =&gt; (
    isa     =&gt; "Num",
    is      =&gt; "rw",
    trigger =&gt; sub {
        my $self = shift;
        $self-&gt;clear_area();
    },
);

has area =&gt; (
    isa        =&gt; "Num",
    is         =&gt; "ro",
    lazy_build =&gt; 1,
);

sub _build_area {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self-&gt;height * $self-&gt;width;
}

</pre>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Unfortunately the implementation is sort of weird. To quote the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/lib/Moose.pm#trigger">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> Triggers will only fire when you <b>assign</b> to the attribute, either in the constructor, or using the writer. Default and built values will <b>not</b> cause the trigger to be fired.</blockquote>

<p>This is a side effect of the original implementation, one that we can no longer change due to compatibility concerns.</p>
<p>Keeping complicated mutable state synchronized is difficult enough as it is, doing that on top of confusing semantics makes it worse. There are many of subtle bugs that you could accidentally introduce, which become very hard to track down.</p>
<p>In <a href="irc://irc.perl.org/#moose"><tt>#moose</tt></a>'s opinion (and mine too, obviously), anything but trivial triggers that just invoke a clearer should be considered <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell">code smell</a>.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>If you find yourself reaching for triggers there are a number of other things you can do.</p>
<p>Usually the best way is to avoid mutable state altogether. This has a number of other advantages (see older posts: <a href="http://blog.woobling.org/2009/05/immutable-data-structures.html">1</a>, <a href="http://blog.woobling.org/2009/05/immutable-data-structures-cont.html">2</a>, <a href="http://blog.woobling.org/2009/06/immutability-part-3.html">3</a>). If you can eliminate mutable state you won't need triggers at all. If you merely reduce mutable state you can still minimize the number and complexity of triggers.</p>

<p>The general approach is to take all of those co-dependent attributes and move them into a separate class. To update the data an instance of that class is constructed from scratch, replacing the old one.</p>
<p>Another approach is to just remove the notion of an attribute from your class's API. Make the attributes that store the mutable data completely private (don't forget to set their <tt>init_arg</tt> to <tt>undef</tt>), and in their place provide a method, preferably one with a clear verb in its name, to modify them in a more structured manner.</p>
<p>Instead of implicitly connecting the attributes using callbacks they are all mutated together in one well defined point in the implementation.</p>
<p>The method can then be used in <tt>BUILD</tt> allowing you to remove any other code paths that set the attributes, so that you only have one test vector to worry about.</p>
<p>The code that Moose generates for you should be helpful, don't let it get in the way of producing clean, robust and maintainable code.</p>

<p>Well if you’ve got nothing to do this long bank holiday weekend (UK hols) then you could enter the <a href="http://contest.github.com/">GitHub Contest</a>. You’ve got till noon Sunday PST to enter your solution <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)"></p>
<p>I’ve had this on my “interesting todo” list for a while now. Like a lot of things on that list which have deadlines they unfortunately tend get passed by <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":("></p>
<p>I’ve made a promise to stay away from computer this bank holiday weekend. Shame because data munging with Perl is something I do enjoy doing.</p>
<p>There have been a few Perl solutions entered:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://contest.github.com/p/jeresig/github-contest">John Resig with 266 score (5.555%)</a> (Yes John Resig of <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> fame and the occasional <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jeresig/">CPAN module</a></li>

<li><a href="http://contest.github.com/p/ultraist/github-contest2009">Ultraist with 2408 score (50.29%)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>John Resig is a cheeky top score ditty <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)"></p>
<p>Ultraist is currently 8th on the <a href="http://contest.github.com/leaderboard">leaderboard</a> with a much more <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/ultraist/20090820">complex solution</a>.</p>
<p>I think this is currently the highest Perl entry…. so good luck Ultraist and all other Perl entries.</p>

                  so games::pandemic 0.8.0 has just been uploaded on cpan. this release saw lots of improvements:<br />

<ul>
<li>diseases can be eradicated</li>
<li>performing infection outbreaks</li>
<li>detecting game over condition when too many outbreaks</li>
<li>allowing player to choose which disease to treat in multi-infected cities</li>
<li>return/escape bindings for dialogs</li>
<li>tooltips for various game information</li>
<li>fix unfair epidemic repartition</li>
<li>fix never-ending too many cards / deal more cards when dropping a card but still being beyond max number of cards</li>

<li>better dialog for past cards / infections</li>
</ul>
the game is thus playable, with only 2 things missing to have a full game: augmenting number of infection when epidemic strikes, and special event cards. when those will be done, i'll issue 1.x<br />
<br />
of course, this does not mean that game is complete and won't be improved after. for example, the startup dialog to choose the game and player roles, ui improvements, etc. will be post 1.x material.<br />
<br />
but in the meantime, enjoy 0.8.0, which is already quite interesting to play.

<span>What is Dada Mail?</span><br />
<br />
Dada Mail is a completely contemporary, mature and intuitive web-based e-mail list management system, which runs on most any Unix-like hosting account that can run custom CGI scripts (details). Dada Mail is also a conceptual art project.<br />
Dada Mail handles Closed-Loop Opt-in/Opt-out subscriptions, sending complex announce-only and/or discussion mailing list messages with an advanced, fault-tolerant mass mailing monitor, supports the archiving/viewing/searching/resending/syndicating (rss, atom) of sent messages and doing all this and a whole lot more with style.<br />
<br />
Dada Mail can handle custom subscriber fields and you can use the information it captures for partial list sending based on a query and Dada Mail's email templating system allows you to create targeted and completely custom email messages for each and every one one of your subscribers.<br />
<br />
Dada Mail is bundled with additional plugins and extensions to extend Dada Mail's capabilities. Some of the plugins/extensions support advanced bounce handling, clickthrough tracking, mass mail scheduling, blog interfaces of archived messages, AJAX subscription form trickery and lots of other surprises.<br />

<br />
Dada Mail produces XHTML valid web content and sticks to best practices when creating email messages. Write Once: Distribute Everywhere. Dada Mail is free software that you're able to use, modify, share and enhance under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Dada Mail is written in Perl because we love Perl.

                  <p><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> 4.3.4 was released recently. Here's the announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GCC 4.3.4 is a bug-fix release containing fixes for regressions and serious bugs in GCC 4.3.3. This release is available from the FTP servers listed at: http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As always, a vast number of people contributed to this GCC release -- <strong>far too many to thank individually</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="http://perlbuzz.com/images/triumph-the-insult-comic-dog.jpg"> "Too many to thank individually?" How many is "too many"? Would the list of GCC contributors have caused multi-megabyte email messages to swamp the mail servers across the Internet?</p>
<p>What this message <em>really</em> says is "I do not want to take the time to thank people individually. Your contributions are not worth a few minutes of my time." What a fantastic way to poop on your contributors. They would have been better off just not mentioning the contributors at all, rather than saying "You're not worth enumerating."</p>

<p>When someone contributes to your project, the least you can do, <em>quite literally</em>, is to include his or her name in a list of credits. Here are the acknowledgements from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize">WWW::Mechanize</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the numerous people who have helped out on WWW::Mechanize in one way or another, including Kirrily Robert for the original WWW::Automate, Gisle Aas, Jeremy Ary, Hilary Holz, Rafael Kitover, Norbert Buchmuller, Dave Page, David Sainty, H.Merijn Brand, Matt Lawrence, Michael Schwern, Adriano Ferreira, Miyagawa, Peteris Krumins, Rafael Kitover, David Steinbrunner, Kevin Falcone, Mike O'Regan, Mark Stosberg, Uri Guttman, Peter Scott, Phillipe Bruhat, Ian Langworth, John Beppu, Gavin Estey, Jim Brandt, Ask Bjoern Hansen, Greg Davies, Ed Silva, Mark-Jason Dominus, Autrijus Tang, Mark Fowler, Stuart Children, Max Maischein, Meng Wong, Prakash Kailasa, Abigail, Jan Pazdziora, Dominique Quatravaux, Scott Lanning, Rob Casey, Leland Johnson, Joshua Gatcomb, Julien Beasley, Abe Timmerman, Peter Stevens, Pete Krawczyk, Tad McClellan, and the late great Iain Truskett.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's everyone who has contributed such that I was able to get their name (e.g. not an anonymous bug in RT).</p>
<p>And whenever I update a change log, which I release as part of release announcements, I put the person's name in there, too, as in this from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/ack/">ack</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Added new switch --column to display the column of the first hit on the row. Thanks to Eric Van Dewoestine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite Miss Manners letters went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Miss Manners, when is a thank you note not required?</p>
<p>Gentle Reader, when no gift is received.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All project coordinators would do well to remember the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: Pete Krawczyk took me task this morning, rightly, for not mentioning that GCC does have a huge contributor list, and they do publish it: <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Contributors.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Contributors.html</a>. My frustration is not in the lack of collection of names, but in the face slap of "There are too many of you too mention." If you get 100 wedding presents, you don't say "That's too many thank you notes to write, so I'm just going to handwave them." I optimize my projects for making sure that everyone's contribution is mentioned at the very least in the Changelog so that people can see their contributions acknowledged in a visible time at the time of release.</p>

                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>The next release of App-Cmd, 0.300, will break backwards compatibility with App::Cmd::Simple. Nothing on the CPAN is registered as using it but I'm sure it's being used. <em>All other uses of App::Cmd should be fine.</em></p>
<p>The issue is that I foolishly used the method name <code>run</code> for both apps and commands. In other words, when you ran this:</p>
<pre>
<code>~$ myapp somecmd --xyzzy
</code>
</pre>
<p>...the result was that <code>MyApp-&gt;run</code> was called, which then called <code>$some_command-&gt;run</code>. This was not a huge deal, except in App::Cmd::Simple, which combines being an app and a command into one class. The existing hack was really gross. If you want to see how it worked, check the code. Basically: it was yuck.</p>

<p>The new code is much better, and reduces the ugliness to a much smaller level, and can probably be further improved without further breakage.</p>
<p>From here on out, commands are expected to have an <code>execute</code> method, not a <code>run</code> method. Normally, if you call <code>run</code> it will find <code>execute</code> and invoke it -- and if you're running your test suite, it will complain that you're using the wrong method name, to encourage you to update to the new name.</p>
<p>Simple can't do that, though. I could have allowed both, but it would have defeated the purpose of simplifying. Instead, I'm declaring it busted and fixing it. After all, this warning appeared in App::Cmd::Simple:</p>

<pre>
<code>This should be considered experimental!
</code>
</pre>
<p>See? My experiment partly failed. Please adjust your code accordingly.</p>

                </h3>
                <div class="entry-content">
                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>I was talking on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/perl">#perl</a> one day, when someone joined and asked:</p>

<pre>
foldr (\(a,b) -&gt; (a:).(b:)) [] $ uncurry zip \
    ("Hv o edyu IPtdy","aeyura orSC oa?") 
    &lt;- What would this be in Perl? (It outputs 
    "Have you read your SICP today?")
</pre>
<p>In case you don't know your Haskell, what it does is interleave the two strings and have 1 letter from here and the other one from here. In Perl, strings are not lists or sequences, so we understood we'd need to split them first to do something like that. Furthermore, we recalled the "zip" function from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/List-MoreUtils/">List-MoreUtils</a> that may prove to be useful.</p>
<p>Eventually, someone came with this Perl 5 solution:</p>
<pre>
perl -MList::MoreUtils=zip -e 'my @former = split //, "Hv o edyu IPtdy"; 
  my @latter = split //, "aeyura orSC oa?"; 
  print join "", zip @former, @latter'
</pre>
<p>Assigning to array variables was necessary because zip has a prototype. Then I figured out that we can avoid that by over-riding the protoype using "&amp;zip", and proposed this solution:</p>

<pre>
perl -MList::MoreUtils=zip -e 'print join "", &amp;zip(map { [split//, $_] } 
    "Hv o edyu IPtdy","aeyura orSC oa?")'
</pre>
<p>Which was much shorter and clearer but used "&amp;zip". What happens is that we pass it the arrays directly as references. I was able to golf it somewhat into:</p>
<pre>
perl -MList::MoreUtils=zip -E 'say&amp;zip(map[split//],"Hv o edyu IPtdy",
"aeyura orSC oa?")'
</pre>
<p>So we got what appears to be a valid use of "&amp;func" to over-ride a pesky prototype. Now, Perl 6 hackers are invited to contribute a Perl 6 solution.</p>

                  <p>The goal of the <a href="http://ali.as/top100">CPAN Top 100</a> website/experiment is to drive the CPAN's awareness of itself.</p>
<p>Researchers in artificial intelligence, emergent behaviour and machine consciousness are still trying to grasp the main concepts of, and reasons for, consciousness.</p>
<p>One of my favourite explanations for the evolutionary reasons behind consciousness is that the increase in knowledge and judgement (based on this knowledge) is that it allows an increase in the efficiency of resource allocation (and a resulting increase in fitness).</p>
<p>As for the skills needed, one of the biggest is to be able to sense the passage of time and be aware of not only aggregate priorities, but to separate priorities into different time scales.</p>
<p>Identifying instantaneous, short, medium and long term priorities allows allocation of more-common, short-time-period volunteer resources to tasks where they can be immediately useful (without these people being distracted by larger long-term goals they are unable to help with).</p>

<p>This is something that I'm afraid I can't do at all yet, but I'm searching for ways to gain this important skill.</p>
<p>As evidence of my failing, and the reason it is important, take the current example of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Class">Test::Class</a></p>
<p>This is a very common, very important test module. 73 other modules depend on t it. Not Top 100 material, but still a big deal.</p>
<p>Currently, the FAIL 100 algorithm identifies it as the 35th highest priority module for attention based on the level of failing tests and the number of things that depend on it.</p>
<p>However, one look at the CPAN Testers page for Test-Class tells an entirely different story. 35th is not the kind of ranking that a human would place on it. A human would noticed the trending of the failure, the suddenness with which it started, and the likelyhood of the problem to cause damage in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/T/Test-Class.html#Test-Class-0.31">http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/T/Test-Class.html#Test-Class-0.31</a></p>
<p>Clearly the current aggregate analysis techniques are just not good enough.</p>
<p>The experiment continues...</p>

                  pair Networks has been using Perl for its software infrastructure since it opened back in 1996, and has been supporting Perl-related events, including the Italian Perl Workshop, for many years. In the August 2009 pair Networks Insider Newsletter, developer Alan Ferrency explains some things about the Account Control Center, which is built in Perl. This excerpt from the August 2009 newsletter (section 4, Developer&apos;s Corner: An Introduction ) is republished with permission from pair Networks, Inc. Hello, and welcome to Developer&apos;s Corner. I&apos;m Alan Ferrency, Lead Software Developer of the pair Networks Account Control Center (ACC) team, and I&apos;ll be your guide. In Developer&apos;s Corner, I&apos;ll present articles on a variety of topics useful for technically oriented pair Networks Web hosting customers. Web site developers, webmasters, and anyone making technical decisions about Web sites will feel at home here. I&apos;d like to start by describing some of the software we use internally at pair Networks to give you an idea of some topics to expect in future articles. As many of you know, pair Networks strongly supports the use and development of Open Source Software. Most of our internal systems depend heavily on Open Source Software, and the Account Control Center is no exception. The ACC Web interface is written in Perl and runs in Apache using mod_perl. We use the Text::MicroMason templating engine and an internally developed application framework. The back end subsystems used by the ACC are also primarily written in Perl. Unlike other configuration systems, the ACC runs on internal servers to avoid wasting system resources on your Web hosting server. Our developers work on private virtual development servers equivalent to a pair Networks VQS, and our production servers start life as standard QuickServe dedicated servers. Our customer support systems are also built on Open Source. Our support request tracking system is written in Perl and integrated with the ACC and internal customer support tools. The phone system uses the Asterisk voice over IP (VoIP) telephony system as well as custom Perl and Ruby code. pair Networks developers have contributed bug reports, patches, and features to a variety of Open Source projects we use here: FreeBSD, Perl, Dovecot, and tcsh to name a few. Some Perl modules developed for internal use are also publicly available and actively maintained on CPAN. The combination of off-the-shelf Open Source systems and custom code allows us great flexibility in developing internal systems. As a pair Networks customer, you have access to the same hardware and tools we use to build our systems. In future months, I&apos;ll describe ways that you can take advantage of this to improve your Web sites and businesses. By the way, pair Networks is also a great hosting solution for the deployment of Perl applications: I&apos;m a long time customer, so I can tell. :-)...

                <div class="entry-content">

                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>The CPAN META Spec is the basis for the META.yml metadata files included in<br />
most modern CPAN distributions. Since the spec was last updated two years<br />
ago, there have been suggestions in many forums for how it could be<br />
improved in clarity or functionality, but nothing has been done.</p>
<p>To move from ideas to implementation, I have convened a working group of<br />
Perl/CPAN toolchain developers, maintainers, packagers and indexers — the<br />
people responsible for the tools you use to configure, build, install or<br />

search for CPAN modules — to review proposals, reach consensus and<br />
ultimately implement a new CPAN META Spec.</p>
<p>To ensure that we benefit from the best ideas in the Perl community, on<br />
behalf of this working group, I am issuing a public call for proposals.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Here is the process and timeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add proposals to the <a href="http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/CPAN_Meta_Spec_Proposals">CPAN Meta Spec Proposals</a> page<br />

on the Perl QA Wiki. Discussion and refinement is encouraged through<br />
the discussion page on the wiki or on the cpan-workers mailing list (see<br />
below for details)</li>
<li>The Call for Proposals will close on Oct. 1, 2009.</li>
<li>The working group will post proposals on the cpan-workers mailing list<br />
for public discussion</li>
<li>Public discussion will close on Nov. 1, 2009.</li>
<li>The working group will reach consensus on proposals to adopt or reject<br />
and release a new CPAN META Spec no later than Dec. 1, 2009.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Criteria</h2>
<p>Since the work of implementation requires volunteer effort, the working<br />
group is looking for incremental improvements rather than complete rewrites<br />
of the spec. Proposal are more likely to be adopted if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve clarity or resolve ambiguity</li>
<li>Are narrow in scope</li>
<li>Address specific, current deficiencies</li>
<li>Are consistent with the general style of the existing spec</li>

<li>Require minimal implementation effort</li>
</ul>

                  <p>Apparently Template had some problems tracking nested <code>IF</code>s and <code>BLOCK</code>s and so they made a change which broke a Jemplate test that was counting on the wrong behavior, so now Jemplate can't compile on Template 2.21_2 and up, latest stable being 2.22.</p>
<p>It was really fun to debug even though before this experience I didn't know Jemplate and Template too well. I just forked Jemplate on github, converted the bad test from Test::Base (which I don't understand much) to Test::More and changed the test to is_string from Test::LongString to really understand where the problem was.</p>
<p>There is a bug standing on this (which I couldn't add to because I didn't open it) and I've emailed Robert Krimen regarding it.</p>

<p>Open Source FTW!</p>

<p>Have fun figuring it out!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since it has caused a bit of confusion on #perl6, it does not print the usual obfu text, but rather a minor variation.</p>

                  [originally posted on Apr 3 2008]
<p>I'd like to express my warm thanks to the lovely people at Yahoo and in particular to their bot-herders. Until quite recently, their web-crawling bots had most irritatingly obeyed robot exclusion rules in the robots.txt file that I have on <a href="http://cpandeps.cantrell.org.uk/">CPANdeps</a>. But in the last couple of weeks they've got rid of that niggling little exclusion so now they're indexing all of the CPAN's dependencies through my site! And for the benefit of their important customers, they're doing it nice and quickly - a request every few seconds instead of the pedestrian once every few minutes that gentler bots use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because generating a dependency tree takes more time than they were allowing between requests, they were filling up my process table, and all my memory, and eating all the CPU, and the only way to get back into the machine was by power-cycling it. So it is with the deepest of regrets that I have had to exclude them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Cunts</a>.</p>

<p>[update] For fuck's sake, they're doing it again from a different netblock!</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>I've been asked a few times how the <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/starry-obfu.html">starry obfu</a> works. Here it is again in all it's <em>*cough*</em> glory:</p>
<pre>
&lt;(*+*)*(*+* +*/*) **** ** * * *+*+*/* **** ** * *
*+*-*/* **** ** * * *+* ****-* **** ** * * *-(*-*/
*) ** (*+*/*) **** ** * * *-* **** ** * * *-*+*/*
**** ** * * *+* **** ** * * *-* * * ***((* - */*)
** * * *-*/*) * * **** ** * * *+*/* ****-* ***(*-*
/*)**(*+*/*) * * ***((*-*/*)** * * *-*/*) * * ****
** * * *+*/* **** ** * * *+*+*/*-* * *&gt;.split(&lt;***

&gt;).map: {eval("(* ** *+*+*-*/*+$_)(&lt;* * *&gt;)").chr\
.print}
</pre>
<p>This first character is a <code>&gt;</code>, which introduces a list quote: <code>&lt;a b c&gt;</code> is the same as <code>("a", "b", "c")</code>. This quote covers the first six and three quarter of the sevenths line.</p>
<p>It is later then used a string (by calling <code>.split</code> on it, and as such stringifies with spaces between the items. So it's roughly the same as <code>"..."</code> in this context.</p>

<p>Then comes a fairly trivial part: the string is split on <code>***</code>, and via <code>map</code> a transformation is applied to to each item: it is interpolated into a string, which is eval'ed. The result is taken as a Unicode codepoint number, and printed to the screen.</p>
<p>To find out what exactly is evaled, you can replace the code inside the <code>map</code> to read something like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;(*+*)*(*+* +*/*) **** ** * * *+*+*/* **** ** * *
... 
&gt;.map: { say("(* ** *+*+*-*/*+$_)(&lt;* * *&gt;)") };

</pre>
<p>The output begins with</p>
<pre>
(* ** *+*+*-*/*+(*+*)*(*+* +*/*) )(&lt;* * *&gt;)
(* ** *+*+*-*/*+* ** * * *+*+*/* )(&lt;* * *&gt;)
</pre>
<p>You might ask yourself <em>"how on earth is this valid Perl code?"</em></p>
<p>The answer is quite simple: a single star can be either a term or an operator in Perl 6. As an infix operator it is simply multiplication. As a term it does magic: It constructs a closure which takes one positional argument, and puts that everywhere where a * appears as a term within that expression.</p>
<p>The reason is to make things like <code>@array[*-1]</code> work: it creates a closure <code>{ $_ - 1 }</code> which is passed on to the array, which in turn passes the number of items in that array to closure, making <code>@array[*-1]</code> return the last array item.</p>

<p>So by the same token <code>* ** *+*+*-*/*+(*+*)*(*+* +*/*)</code> is internally transformed to</p>
<pre>
{ $_ ** $_ + $_ + $_ - $_ / $_ + ($_ + $_ ) * ($_ + $_ + $_/ $_) }
</pre>
<p>The <code>(&lt;* * *&gt;)</code> behind it invokes that closure with a list consisting of three items. In numerical context that becomes just the number 3, so the above translates to <code>3**3 + 3 + 3 - 3/3 + (3+3) * (3 + 3 + 3/3)</code>, evaluated 74 - the Unicode codepoint (and at the same time ASCII code) for the letter capital <code>J</code>.</p>

<p>It works similarly for all other letters; mystery lifted.</p>

                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>The other day <a href="http://sushee.schreibsturm.org/">Su-Shee</a> asked on IRC if I could tell her which components of <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> are written in which programming language. So here it is:</p>
<p><img src="http://perlgeek.de/images/rakudo-flow-2.png" alt="Rakudo flow chart"></p>
<p>The source code is entered at the top of the machine named Rakudo, and is transformed in various stages. The first two, parser and action methods, are actually part of Rakudo, and are hosted in the Rakudo repository. They are written in two different subsets of Perl 6, the regexes (parser), and "Not Quite Perl 6", short NQP (action methods).</p>

<p>The next two stages (PAST and POST compiler) are part of the so-called "Parrot Compiler Toolkit", short PCT. Both PAST and POST are structural representations of the program, with PAST being more high-level than POST. Both compilers are written in PIR, the parrot assembly language, and are distributed along with parrot. They are also used by many other parrot based languages.</p>
<p>The POST compiler emits PIR, which IMCC transforms into byte code. IMCC is parrot's PIR compiler, written in C and statically linked into parrot. The byte code (PBC) can then be stored to disk, or executed in memory by a so-called <em>run core</em> or <em>run loop</em>, which is in some sense the heart of parrot - or one of the hearts, because there are several different ones available (one for just-in-time compilation (JIT), one for debugging etc.).</p>
<p>There are also some supporting custom types and operations in Rakudo called <em>dynamic PMCs</em> and <em>dynamic ops</em> which are written in C, and helper functions written in other languages (namely NQP and PIR). Those do not show up in the flow chart.</p>

<p>The part of Rakudo described so far is the <em>stage one</em> compiler. In the build process it is compiled first, and then it compiles the <em>setting library</em> down to PBC. "Setting library" is a fancy term describing the built-in functions which are written in Perl&nbsp;6. The result of this compilation (together with a low level runtime library in PIR) is linked together with the stage one compiler and parrot, the result is the <code>perl6</code> executable.</p>

                  For the last few months I've been using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> for my version control system. It's better than CVS because it can handle offline commits. So if I'm using my laptop on a train, I can still use version control without having to have a notwork connection.
<p>And to give a pretty web front-end to it for other people to <a href="http://www.cantrell.org.uk/cgit/">read code</a> without having to check it out of the repository, I use <a href="http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/">cgit</a>, which I mostly chose because it's a dead simple CGI and not a huge fancy application.</p>
<p>One problem with cgit is that by default it doesn't do code highlighting. But it has the ability to run blobs of code through any filter you care to name before displaying them, so to get something nice like <a href="http://www.cantrell.org.uk/cgit/cgit.cgi/perlmodules/tree/Sub-WrapPackages/lib/Sub/WrapPackages.pm?id=db12893c451365b8f546b9f253735be1c542b6c0">this</a> all you need to do is write a highlighter and add a single line to your cgitrc:</p>

<p><code>source-filter=/web/www.cantrell.org.uk/cgit/highlighter</code></p>
<p>My highlighter program is this:</p>
<pre>
   1 #!/usr/local/bin/perl

   3 <b><font color="#8B008B">use</font></b> warnings;

                  <p><strong>&lt;update&gt;</strong> (from 2009-08-23) It turned out that my disappearance on the ironman blog feed was due to a broken RSS feed. Matt S. Trout tried to inform me by blog comment, my blog marked it as spam and swallowed it.</p>

<p>So now we talked on IRC, clarified things, and I'm back in the game. <strong>&lt;/update&gt;</strong></p>
<p>So I accepted the <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">Iron Man</a> blogging challenge a few month ago. And last week I discovered that my blog was gone from their feed. For the second time. Without any notification.</p>

</div>
<p>The first time they had a good reason: the date tags in my RSS feed were goofed; still I'd thought it would be nice to at least notify me of such a removal. After some mails back and forth I was able to fix it; after the second removal without any notification I'm simply fed up and don't want to investigate any more energy into this.</p>
<p>Still I'll continue to follow the collected RSS feed, there are still many interesting blogs to be read there.</p>

                  I am ill. I've been ill since Thursday, with a cold. You're meant to be able to cure a cold with [insert old wives tale remedy here] in 5 days, or if you don't, it'll clear itself up in just under a week. So hopefully today is the last day.
<p>So what have I done while ill?</p>

<p>On Friday I became old (see previous post), and went to the <a href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/byzantium/">Byzantium</a> exhibition at the Royal Academy. It was good. You should go.</p>
<p>Saturday was the <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/lpw2008/">London Perl Workshop</a>. My talk on closures went down well, and people seemed to understand what I was talking about. Hurrah! I decided that rather than hang around nattering and going to a few talks, I'd rather hide under my duvet for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>I mostly hid on Sunday too, and spent most of the day asleep. In a brief moment of productivity, I got my laptop and my phone to talk to each other using magic interwebnet bluetooth stuff. I'd tried previously without success, but that was with the previous release of OS X. With version X.5 it seems to Just Work, so no Evil Hacks were necessary.</p>
<p>The cold means that I can't taste a damned thing, not even bacon. So now I know what it's like to be Jewish. Being Jewish <em>sucks</em>.</p>
<p>And today, I am still coughing up occasional lumps of lung and making odd bubbling noises in my chest, although my nasal demons seem to be Snotting less than they were, so hopefully I'll be back to normal tomorrow.</p>

                  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Devel%3A%3ACheckLib&amp;mode=all">Devel::CheckLib</a> has grown a new feature. As well as checking that libraries and headers exist, it can now also check that particular functions exist in a library and check their return values. This will be particularly useful if you need to check that a particular <em>version</em> of a library is available.
<p>It works if you have a Unixish toolchain. I need to wait for the CPAN-testers reports to see if I managed not to break anything on Windows. Unfortunately, even though the lovely Mr. Alias has worked hard to make <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/39318">Windows machines available to developers</a>, I found it to be just too hard to use. Even downloading my code to the Windows machine was hard, as Windows seemed to think it knew better and shouldn't download the file I told it to download. Then once I had downloaded it, Windows decided to hide it somewhere that I couldn't get to using the command line. So I gave up.</p>

<p>I might try again once there are some decent tools on the machines: wget, tar, and gzip at minimum, as given those I can quickly bootstrap anything else. Software development isn't just about having compilers available.</p>

                  One of my CPAN distributions is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=CPAN-FindDependencies">CPAN-FindDependencies</a>. It contains a module CPAN::FindDependencies, and a simple script that wraps around it so you can view dependencies easily from the command line. That script, naturally, has a man page. However, that manpage basically says "if you want to know what arguments this program takes, see the CPAN::FindDependencies docs". This is Bad from a usability point of view, good from a not-duplicating-stuff point of view, and good from a laziness point of view. Which means that it's Bad.
<p>So, the solution.</p>
<blockquote><tt>=over</tt>
<p><tt>#include shared/parameters</tt></p>
<p><tt>=back</tt></p>

</blockquote>
<p>and some <a href="http://www.cantrell.org.uk/cgit/cgit.cgi/perlmodules/tree/CPAN-FindDependencies/Makefile.PL?id=b643a4d95f300552b9af9e7edd1fef9ae96543b3">Magic</a> that does the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.3/cpp/">cpp-stylee</a> substitution at <code>make dist</code> time. Note the 'dist' section in my call to <code>WriteMakefile</code>.</p>
<p>This is, of course, crying out to be made less horribly hacky, but it works for now, so I'm happy.</p>
<p>My original idea was to write some crazy shit that would do the #include at install-time, when the user was installing my code. But that has the disadvantage that tools like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan</a> wouldn't show it properly, as they simply look at the files in the distribution. So this does the #includes at the last moment just before I package up the code and upload to the PAUSE. You lovely people get the right documentation in all the right places, I only have to maintain it in one place so it stays in sync, and (in the interests of Laziness) I don't have to remember to run any extra scripts before releasing, <code>make dist</code> just Does The Right Thing.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>
<ul>
<li>File test operations now look like <code>$str.IO ~~ :e</code> (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=27503">r27503</a>)</li>

<li>Some cool regex features were documented that previously only existed unofficially (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=27692">r27692</a>, <a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=27695">r27695</a>)</li>
<li>The want() function was removed as unimplementable (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=27755">r27755</a>).</li>
<li>Subroutines without signatures don't always default to <code>(*@_, *%_)</code>, only when these variables are actually used (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=27801">r27801</a>).</li>
<li>Nil coercions (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=27882">r27882</a>)</li>

<li>Embedded comments now look like <code>#`[...]</code> (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=27959">r27959</a>)</li>
<li><code>infix:&lt;/&gt;(Int, Int)</code> now produces a Rat object, that is a fraction.</li>
<li>Changes to context, variables (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28151">r28151</a>); <code>::=</code> now does read-only binding (instead of compile time binding as before) (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/svn/pugs/revision/?rev=28150">r28150</a>)</li>

</ul>
<h2>Rakudo</h2>
<p>Rakudo had two releases by people other than Patrick Michaud, namely by me and Kyle Hasselbacher.</p>
<p>Among the highlights are much improved introspection capabilities, user defined traits, user defined and overloadable operators.</p>
<p>Jonathan also worked on the prototype of <a href="http://github.com/jnthn/blizkost/tree/master">perl 5 integration into parrot</a>.</p>
<h2>MP6</h2>
<p>Flavio Glock <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.announce/2009/08/msg603.html">updated mp6 and bootstrapped in on SBCL</a>.</p>

<h2>perl6.org</h2>
<p>We now have a <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/a-shiny-perl6-org.html">shiny perl6.org site</a>.</p>

                  As is becoming normal, I used the times between talks to bugfix some of my modules - this time <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~dcantrell/Tie-STDOUT-1.03/">Tie::STDOUT</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~dcantrell/Data-Transactional-1.0/">Data::Transactional</a>. The former was failing on perl 5.6, the latter on 5.9.5. The former was a bug in perl (you can't localise tied filehandles and expect the tieing to go away in 5.6, so it now declares a dependency on 5.8), the latter was a bug in my code.

<p>Philippe Bruhat's talk on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~book/Net-Proxy-0.08/">Net::Proxy</a> was great - you can tell it's great because I came away with ideas for at least four things that I <em>need</em> to write. First up will be a plugin for it to allow the user to specify minimum and maximum permitted data rates for proxied connections. This will permit bandwidth limits for maximum permitted rates, but will also help to defeat IDSes doing traffic analysis if you specify a minimum permitted data rate.</p>
<p>This will protect (eg) ssh sessions from being identified based on their very bursty traffic pattern, by "filling in the blanks" with junk data.</p>
<p>In the evening, the CPAN-testers BOF was productive.</p>

                  I have released my <a href="http://www.cantrell.org.uk/david/tech/perl-modules/XML-Tiny-1.0.tar.gz">XML::Tiny</a> module. The parser at its core is less than twenty lines of code. Pretty easy to follow code too, I think, and that also includes error handling. One of my aims in writing it was to keep memory usage and code to the absolute minimum, so it doesn't handle all of XML. The documentation says that it supports "a useful subset of XML". Personally, I think it supports <em>the</em> useful subset. It's certainly enough to parse the data I get back from Amazon when I use their web services, and to parse an RSS feed.

                  To make up for a disappointing gap in Palm&apos;s software for the Treo smartphone, I wrote a &lt;a href=http://www.cantrell.org.uk/david/tech/treo/call-dumper/&gt;small perl script&lt;/a&gt; to parse the database that stores my call history.  I then re-wrote it as &lt;a href=http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Palm%3A%3ATreoPhoneCallDB&gt;a re-useable module&lt;/a&gt; which also figgers out whether the call was incoming or outgoing.

                  A day of not many talks, but lots of cool stuff. Damian was his usual crazy self, and MJD's talk on building parsers was really good. Although I probably won't use those techniques at work as functional programming seems to scare people.
<p>The conference dinner at a <a href="http://wikiproxy.cantrell.org.uk/Heuriger">Heuriger</a> on the outskirts of Vienna was great. The orga-punks had hired a small fleet of buses to get us there and back, and one of the sponsors laid on a great buffet. The local wine was pretty damned fine too, and then the evening de-generated into Schnapps, with toasts to Her Majesty, to her splendid navy, and to The Village People.</p>
<p>It wasn't all debauchery in the evening though - on the bus, I had a very useful chat with <a href="http://www.bruhat.net/">Philippe</a> about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~book/Net-Proxy-0.08/">Net::Proxy</a>, and re-designing it to make it easier to create new connectors for it.</p>

                  There were quite a few interesting talks in the morning, especially Ivor's one on packaging perl applications. Oh, and mine about rsnapshot, of course, in which people laughed at the right places and I judged the length of it just right, finishing with a couple of minutes left for questions.
<p>At the traditional end-of-YAPC auction, I avoided spending my usual stupid amounts of money on stupid things, which was nice. Obviously the hundred quid I put in to buying the hair style of next year's organisers wasn't stupid. Oh no. Definitely not.</p>

                  My <a href="http://www.justanotherperlhacker.org/lightning/index.shtml">Lightning Talk</a> on <a href="http://cpandeps.cantrell.org.uk/">cpandeps</a> went down really well, although as José pointed out, I need to fix it to take account of <a href="http://cpandeps.cantrell.org.uk/?module=File%3A%3ACopy">File::Copy</a> being <a href="http://abigail1.hates-software.com/2005/09/21/0692681a.html">broken</a>. I also need to talk to Domm after the conference is over to see if I can get dependency information from CPANTS as well as from META.yml files.

<p>There were lots of other good lightning talks. Dmitri Karasik's regexes for doing OCR, Juerd Waalboer's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~juerd/Unicode-Semantics-1.00/">Unicode::Semantics</a>, and Renée Bäcker's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ctrondlp/Win32-GuiTest-1_50.5/">Win32::GuiTest</a> were especially noteworthy.</p>
<p>Richard Foley's brief intro to the perl debugger was also useful. Unfortunately Hakim Cassimally's talk was about debugging <em>web</em> applications, which I'd not noticed on the schedule, so I didn't stay for that.</p>
<p>And finally, Mark Fowler's grumble about why perl sucks (and what to do about it) had a few interesting little things in it. I am having vaguely sick ideas about mixing some of that up with an MJD-stylee parser.</p>
<p>At the auction I paid €250 to have the Danish organisers of next year's YAPC::Europe wear the Swedish flag on their foreheads. This, I should point out, was <a href="http://drinkbroken.typepad.com/">Greg</a>'s idea. I would never be so evil on my own.</p>

                  <p>I'm very pleased to announce that <a href="http://perl6.org/">perl6.org</a> now got a shiny new face - the one that <a href="http://sushee.schreibsturm.org/">Su-Shee</a> developed for perl6-projects.org. I'd also like to thank <a href="http://www.dwright.org/">Daniel Wright</a>, owner of the perl6.org domain, for making that domain available to us.</p>

<p>The story behind it is as simple as amazing: I noticed that we had no good, up to date overview of what Perl&nbsp;6 projects existed out there. So I bought the domain perl6-projects.org, put up a few lists of different projects - and gave it a rather bad design. Because I may be decent with programming, blogging and explaining things, but as a designer I simply suck.</p>
<p>But what I did was sticking the source code into a public repository (the pugs repository, to be exact) to which it is very easy to gain access, and made the server pull from that repository every 15 minutes. So basically everybody who wanted could update the site.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, four month later Su-Shee contributed a nice design, which we modified in small things based on feedback from #perl6.</p>
<p>Slowly it dawned to me (and others probably) that this site had the potential to be much larger in scope than a simple project list - it could evolve into the central web site for Perl 6 developers and users. With the small caveat that <code>perl6.org</code> would have been a much nicer domain name - but it was taken already.</p>
<p>But the whois entry gave us hope - it belongs to Daniel Wright, and a quick google search turned up that he's a perl monger, organizer and attendee of YAPC conferences. So we decided that pmichaud should contact him, being more of an authority in Perl 6 land than me.</p>
<p>After a few exchanged mails we found out that Daniel's and our goals matched, so about one day later he changed the DNS to the same IP that perl6-projects.org uses, I added another alias to the virtual host, and we were done.</p>
<p>It's a prime example both for attracting contributors, and for what you can reach by simply talking to people. Thanks to everyone involved.</p>

                  Perl isn't dieing, but it tells me that it wishes it was. Last night it went out on the piss with Python and Ruby (PHP was the designated driver) and it did rather too many cocktails. It isn't quite sure what happened, but it woke up in the gutter in a puddle of its own fluids and its head hurts a <em>lot</em>.
<p>It asked me to ask you all to keep the volume down.</p>

<p>The first two legs of that are second class, cos first wasn't available on Eurostar (being a Friday evening it's one of the commuter Eurostars and gets booked up months and months in advance) and was way too spendy on the sleeper to Munich. Upgrading to first class from Munich to Vienna is cheap, so I have.</p>
<p>Coming back it's first class all the way cos upgrading was nearly free ...</p>

<p>Don't even think about trying to book online or over the phone, or at the Eurostar ticket office at Waterloo. Your best bet is to go to the Rail Europe shop on Picadilly, opposite the Royal Academy and next to Fortnums.</p>

                <a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/object-construction-and-initialization.html">Let&apos;s build an object</a>
                </h3>
                <div class="entry-content">
                
                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>Building an object in Perl&nbsp;6 is rather easy. As the author of a class you don't really have to care (at least in the simplest case), you inherit a default constructor from class <code>Object</code>. As a consumer of that class you just write <code>YourClass.new(attrib1 =&gt; $value1)</code> to create an object of class <code>YourClass</code>, at the same time initializing an attribute.</p>

<h2>Running initializations code</h2>
<p>If you want to run some initialization code on object creation, you don't have to touch the <code>new</code> method at all. Something like this works:</p>
<pre>
<span class="synStatement">class</span> C {
    <span class="synStatement">submethod</span> BUILD {
        <span class="synIdentifier">say</span> <span class="synSpecial">"</span><span class="synConstant">Created a new instance of C</span><span class="synSpecial">"</span><span class="synStatement">;</span>

    }
}

C<span class="synStatement">.</span><span class="synIdentifier">new</span>()<span class="synStatement">;</span>
</pre>
<p>The BUILD submethod is called by the constructor automatically, and can do any initialization that's necessary. It also receives the named arguments that the user passes on to <code>new()</code>.</p>
<p>(In case you wonder, a submethod is a public method that's not inherited to child classes).</p>
<h2>Custom constructors</h2>
<p>Suppose you're not a big fan of named arguments, and you want to write a constructor that takes one mandatory positional parameter. In that case you'd write a custom <code>new</code> method. To create an object, that method has to call <code>self.bless</code>:</p>

<pre>
<span class="synStatement">class</span> C {
    <span class="synSpecial">has</span> <span class="synIdentifier">$</span><span class="synSpecial">.</span><span class="synIdentifier">size</span><span class="synStatement">;</span>
    <span class="synStatement">method</span> <span class="synIdentifier">new</span>(<span class="synIdentifier">$x</span>) {
        <span class="synIdentifier">self</span><span class="synStatement">.</span><span class="synIdentifier">bless</span>(<span class="synStatement">*,</span> <span class="synConstant">size</span> <span class="synStatement">=&gt;</span> <span class="synConstant">2</span> <span class="synStatement">*</span> <span class="synIdentifier">$x</span>)<span class="synStatement">;</span>

    }
}

<span class="synIdentifier">say</span> C<span class="synStatement">.</span><span class="synIdentifier">new</span>(<span class="synConstant">3</span>)<span class="synStatement">.</span>size<span class="synStatement">;</span>      <span class="synComment"># prints 6</span>
</pre>

<p>The star <code>*</code> as the first argument to <code>bless</code> tells it to create an empty object itself.</p>
<p>If you want to enable additional named parameters, that's easily done:</p>
<pre>
<span class="synStatement">class</span> C {
    <span class="synSpecial">has</span> <span class="synIdentifier">$</span><span class="synSpecial">.</span><span class="synIdentifier">size</span><span class="synStatement">;</span>

    <span class="synStatement">method</span> <span class="synIdentifier">new</span>(<span class="synIdentifier">$x</span><span class="synStatement">,</span> <span class="synIdentifier">%n</span>) {
        <span class="synIdentifier">self</span><span class="synStatement">.</span><span class="synIdentifier">bless</span>(<span class="synStatement">*,</span> <span class="synConstant">size</span> <span class="synStatement">=&gt;</span> <span class="synConstant">2</span> <span class="synStatement">*</span> <span class="synIdentifier">$x</span><span class="synStatement">,</span> <span class="synStatement">|</span><span class="synIdentifier">%n</span>)<span class="synStatement">;</span>

    }
}
</pre>
<p>Note that these two concepts (custom new() and BUILD() (sub)methods) are orthogonal; you can use both at once, and both peacefully coexist.</p>
<h2>Understanding object initialization</h2>
<p>As demonstrated above you don't need to understand the full process of building and initializing objects to manipulate it. If you still want to know, read on.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a class <code>C</code> which inherits from another class <code>B</code>, then the process of building an object of class <code>C</code> looks like this:</p>

<img src="http://perlgeek.de/images/creation.png" alt="Perl 6 object creation">
<p>The user calls <code>C.new</code> (which is inherited from class Object), which in turn calls <code>self.bless(*, |%args)</code>. <code>bless</code> creates a new <code>P6Opaque</code> object which is the storage for the newly created object. This is the call to <code>CREATE</code> in the image above.</p>

<p>After the storage has been allocated and the attributes initialized, <code>new</code> passes control to <code>BUILDALL</code> (passing along all named parameters), which in turn calls <code>BUILD</code> in all classes in the inheritance hierarchy, starting at the top of the hierarchy and calling the BUILD method of class <code>C</code> at last.</p>
<p>This design allows you to substitute parts of the initialization with least effort, and especially writing custom <code>new</code> and <code>BUILD</code> methods very easily.</p>

<p>Instead of passing a <code>*</code> to <code>bless</code>, you can also pass along an object of different storage type, which means that you can instruct Perl 6 to store your objects by a different mechanism, for example by the gnome library <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/unstable/">GObject</a> or similar (though that's not yet implemented in Rakudo).</p>

[...]
14:11 &lt; pugs_svn&gt; r28045 | wayland++ | [S02,S03,S09,S11] Changed any example

14:11 &lt; pugs_svn&gt; r28045 | wayland++ | instead (both have kittens), because we 
                  already have a type called Cat and a 
14:11 &lt; pugs_svn&gt; r28045 | wayland++ | method called "cat", and I could see 
                  some potential for confusion.  
[...]
14:14 &lt;@moritz_&gt; wayland76: +     %cats\   .{'fluffy'} = Squirrel.new;
14:15 &lt;@jnthn&gt; Squirrel is not a type of cat?
14:15 &lt;@moritz_&gt; well, it would be sensible to name the variable %squirrels in 
                 that case ;-)
14:18 &lt; pugs_svn&gt; r28046 | moritz++ | [S03] store Squirrels in %squirrels, not

14:20  * jnthn likes surrealism.
14:20  * masak fish surrealism
14:37 &lt;@frettled&gt; moritz_: You know, the cats may disagree and think that 
                  squirrels _should_ be stored in cats.  Just mentioning it.
14:37 &lt;@jnthn&gt; wantfud!
14:38 &lt;@wayland76&gt; well, those cats can go clarify their Whatever 
                   comprehensions for all I care :)
14:38 &lt;@masak&gt; one would think that cats have been evolved to store rodents.
14:39 &lt;@wayland76&gt; I doubt the rodents think of it as "storage" :)

                  <p>I think I mentioned once or twice that regexes and grammars in Perl 6 really rock. Most Perl 6 compilers use them to parse Perl 6, which demonstrates how powerful they are. Writing a full grammar for <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> took only <a href="http://github.com/moritz/json/blob/43d69db6a549869110f8b97ba7c635946ab733b4/lib/JSON/Tiny/Grammar.pm">about 70 generously spaced lines</a>.</p>
<p>A successful match stores all kind of captures in a <code>Match</code> objects, which is actually a full match tree. If you're new to Perl&nbsp;6 regexes, you might find the structure a bit surprising at first.</p>

<p>So I wrote a module which visualizes a match tree, annotating parts of the original string with the access path on the match object.</p>

<p>My first reaction was "no, they aren't parallel" because the big jumps don't happen at the same time, but still there are large areas where they do seem to grow roughly at the same rate. So what's up?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell there are two mechanism at work here. The first one accounts for much of the past behaviour: tests were moved from the old part of the pugs test suite to the official test suite (where they are counted towards the grey line), and at the same time people also tried to get it to run under Rakudo - mostly successfully, as the green line shows.</p>
<p>Now most test files are actually moved to the official Perl 6 test suite, there are less than 200 tests left to move (as opposed to 17k already moved), and this mechanism is drained.</p>
<p>The second mechanism is that as soon as Rakudo implements a cool new feature, we realize that we need more tests for it, and people write more tests for it. (It's rather hard to write tests for language feature that doesn't run yet. "test first" is a nice idea, but it only works to some extent in reality). Also people explore the new features, find bugs, and bug tickets are only closed if there are tests for them, so even more spec tests that coincide with passing Rakudo tests.</p>

                  <p>Two weeks ago <a href="http://pmichaud.com/">Patrick Michaud</a> asked for <a href="http://rakudo.org/node/49">volunteers to release</a> <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl 6</a>.</p>

<p>So I first did a fake release some days ago, and it went pretty well. All I had to do was follow <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/9b37b818f4df7002411c877235c192dcfc2a0c7b/docs/release_guide.pod">the instructions</a> - no magic required.</p>
<p>Then it turned out that Patrick was busy at the OSCON, and asked me to do the July release for real. <a href="http://rakudo.org/node/50">Which I did</a>. Which was also no magic.</p>
<p>Please note that I am familiar with Rakudo, I know in which steps it is built, where which functionality is - but I'm very far from understanding how most things work; luckily I didn't have to.</p>
<p>All in all I think I spent about an hour for the release, not counting the time in which I built it and ran tests - but those things didn't require any attention, I did other things in the mean time.</p>
<p>So to summarize: it's simple; you don't have to be an über hacker to do it. You just need some basic familiarity with Rakudo, and a bit of free time.</p>
<p>If you want to support us and gather some fame, consider doing a release for us.</p>

                  <div class="entry-body">
                  <p>(<strong>Update:</strong>: <a href="http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/39411">Here is the "official" blog post from pmichaud</a> - which pretty much makes my rambling superfluous.)</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://pmichaud.com/">Patrick Michaud</a> announced that he'll <a href="http://brunorc.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/perl-6-release-or-xmas-in-easter/">release a special version of Rakudo called <em>Rakudo star</em></a> in Spring 2010. Sadly I was not present, but as minor minion I picked some things up on IRC and want to provide some backgrounds.</p>

<p>Alias <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/39406">bitched about the term "Spring"</a>, which is a rather regional thing and of course he is right. I'd like to clarify that we are talking about spring on the northern hemisphere, so the release will probably be between March and June.</p>
<p>The idea behind this release is to provide something more shiny than our usual development releases, get good press for it, and motivate lots of people to use it. We need that for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A release is the only way to get good testing from a wide audience; we learned as much from the perl-5.10.0 release, for which many new bugs were only found after the release.</li>
<li>Many Perl 5 programmers are vaguely excited about Perl 6, but wait for a "real thing" before they spend more time on it. We want to show these people that Rakudo has become a "real thing" by now, and implements much of the language.</li>
<li>We want to encourage hackers to port their Perl 5 modules to Perl 6. For them it's a good way to learn Perl 6, for the rest of the community it provides a valuable ecosystem. Perl is a good example of how a great collection of libraries can greatly enhance a languages popularity - we'd like to have such a bonus for Perl 6 too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently the Rakudo developers mostly focus on features that are either at the very heart of Perl 6, or that are needed for bootstrapping. Examples for the first category re the object model, multi dispatch and regexes/grammars. The second category covers features like contextual variables, proto regexes and longest token matching.</p>
<p>I expect the focus to (temporarily) shift towards other features, like improved module loading/importing and maybe speedups. But still there are areas that not yet actively pursued - the <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/24b26a0e5319646877f9cdfa5976062e1a02b95a/docs/ROADMAP">roadmap</a> does not even mention concurrency/threads. So we hope for volunteers to step up and champion their pet projects.</p>

<p>In the last few months various pieces of PR helped to bring more people into the Perl 6 community. I hope that the Rakudo star release will boost that and will help to form a healthy Perl 6 community.</p>

                  <h2>The Quest</h2>
<p>It usually begins with <a href="http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal">Carl Mäsak</a> - this time was no exception.</p>
<p>First he <a href="http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39445">sent us on big adventure</a>, and then <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-08-14#i_1393669">me on a particular quest</a> by asking innocently if there were any vistor statics for the site <a href="http://perl6-projects.org/">http://perl6-projects.org</a>. Being curious myself I copied the access.log, started <a href="http://www.hping.org/visitors">a log analyzer</a> and voilá, we had a HTML page with some statistics.</p>

<p>But a tiny nagging voice in my head asked <em>Can't you do that with Perl&nbsp;6?</em>. Well, sure I can, with a bit of effort.</p>
<p>So I decided to spend some time of my weekend (namely a travel by train and the time when my girlfriend took a nap) on this, and wrote a web log analyzer that produced a bar chart of the daily number of visitors. Here it goes:</p>
<img src="http://perlgeek.de/images/p6p-access.png" alt="visitor stats for perl6-projects.org">
<p>If you use a browser that supports SVG, you can <a href="/images/p6p-access.svg">view the svg version directly.</a>.</p>
<p>That was the short story. If you are more of a geek, you might be more interested in some of technical details.</p>
<h2>The Gory Details - SVG</h2>
<p>The choice of SVG as output format was pretty obvious: It's text based, a vector format, and masak had already <a href="http://github.com/masak/svg/">written a SVG module for Perl 6</a>. Despite its name, it's actually a module that generally transforms data structures of a particular form to XML - the only things specific to SVG in there are the name and the documentation.</p>

<p>Since it doesn't know about SVG, I as the programmer had to learn some SVG. So I downloaded the specs, and went offline.</p>
<h2>Coordinate transformations</h2>
<p>Skimming through the specs revealed something interesting: you can apply coordinate transformations to SVG primitives or groups. Also the drawing area stretches from negative to positive infinity in both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> direction. In combination that means that the plotting module can start drawing without looking at the whole input data. It just has to keep track of how much space it has written to, and then in the end it can apply a scaling to fit the canvas (ie the visible drawing area).</p>
<p>There's just one problem with this approach:</p>
<img src="http://perlgeek.de/images/distorted.png" alt="distorted text">
<p>The text is scaled with the same aspect ratio as the chart, leading to distorted text. Of course one could apply the reverse transformation to the text, but to avoid overlapping label text one has to know the size of the text anyway, so there's nothing gained by letting the SVG renderer do coordinate transformation.</p>

<p>So I ended up doing the scaling in my program code after all.</p>
<h2>Text in SVG</h2>
<p>There's one open problem so far: since the plotting program just emits SVG (or more accurately, a data structure which SVG.pm turns into SVG) and doesn't know about its rendering, it can't know how much space the text will take up, making it impossible to calculate the spaces appropriately. Inkscape and gqview render the text quite differently, I'm sure other user agents will have their own interpretation of text sizes and scaling.</p>
<p>The specs talks about precomputed text width according to which text might be scaled; I'll have to see if I can make use of that feature to solve this problem.</p>
<h2>SVG != SVG</h2>
<p>Speaking of different user agents: Firefox and gqview only show drawing on the canvas, silently (as per SVG spec) dropping elements outside the canvas. It was incredible helpful to have inkscape, which shows the border of the canvas, but also objects outside of it. When I got a coordinate transform wrong, that was a good way to debug it.</p>
<h2>Mandatory Options</h2>
<p>I made one observation not tied to SVG, but to plotting in general: without having planned for it, I ended up with having about ten configuration variables/attributes, more to come when I include captions, axis labels and so on. It just falls naturally out of process of writing the code, and thinking twice each time I used a numeric constant in code.</p>
<p>Perl&nbsp;6 makes them very nice, the begin of the code looks like this:</p>

}
</pre>
<p>Basically I declare attributes with default values, which can be overridden by passing a named argument to the <code>new</code> constructor - and the subsequent declarations which depend on them simply pick up the user supplied value if present, or the default otherwise.</p>
<p>It seems easier to come up with a myriad of configuration options than choosing sane defaults.</p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>... can be found on <a href="http://github.com/moritz/svg-plot/">http://github.com/moritz/svg-plot/</a>. The log parser is included in the <code>examples/</code> directory.</p>

<p>It is far from complete, the interface is not yet stable etc, but it's still a nice piece of software, IMHO.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>I want to pursue development in a few directions: more meta data (axis labels, captions, annotations, maybe clickable data points), other chart types (lines and points), documentation, and maybe more styling options.</p>
<p>I don't know yet how to write unit tests for it, and test driven development only works if you know in advance what to expect.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'll find the time to turn this into a full-blown charting module, but so far the work on it has been very rewarding, and I liked it.</p>
